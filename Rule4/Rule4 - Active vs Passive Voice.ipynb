      "Active Voice Sentence: From the time Cézanne first left Aix, at the age of twenty-two, Louis-Auguste paid his bills, even when Cézanne gave every indication of being nothing more than a failed dilettante.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: But for Zola, Cézanne would have remained an unhappy banker’s son in Provence; but for Pissarro, he would never have learned how to paint; but for Vollard (at the urging of Pissarro, Renoir, Degas, and Monet), his canvases would have rotted away in some attic; and, but for his father, Cézanne’s long apprenticeship would have been a financial impossibility.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: That is an extraordinary list of patrons.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: The first three—Zola, Pissarro, and Vollard—would have been famous even if Cézanne never existed, and the fourth was an unusually gifted entrepreneur who left Cézanne four hundred thousand francs when he died.\n",

      "Active Voice Sentence: But Louis-Auguste didn’t have to support Cézanne all those years.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: He would have been within his rights to make his son get a real job, just as Sharie might well have said no to her husband’s repeated trips to the chaos of Haiti.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: She could have argued that she had some right to the life style of her profession and status—that she deserved to drive a BMW, which is what power couples in North Dallas drive, instead of a Honda Accord, which is what she settled for.\n",

      "Active Voice Sentence: But she believed in her husband’s art, or perhaps, more simply, she believed in her husband, the same way Zola and Pissarro and Vollard and—in his own, querulous way—Louis-Auguste must have believed in Cézanne.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: Late bloomers’ stories are invariably love stories, and this may be why we have such difficulty with them.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: We’d like to think that mundane matters like loyalty, steadfastness, and the willingness to keep writing checks to support what looks like failure have nothing to do with something as rarefied as genius.\n",
      "Active Voice Sentence: But sometimes genius is anything but rarefied; sometimes it’s just the thing that emerges after twenty years of working at your kitchen table.\n",

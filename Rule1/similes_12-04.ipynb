    "take a big corpus with trite similes (Pulp Fiction collection, War and Peace, Romance books, [The Daily Mail](http://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/)), prepare clean sentences, traverce throug the corpus sen by sen, POS-tagging each and looking for sentences containing prepositions \"like\" and \"as-as\" (tag = \"IN\") and exclude \"as soon as, as well as, as usual, such as, as of yet, as much, like that, like this..\" (alternatively, use dependency parser to accurately cut out a phrase. but it's a pain and may be an overkill). Add these sentences to a target corpus. Cut out a simile candidate (segment of a sentence) out of each sentence; replace \"likes\" and \"ases\" with a \"comparator\".  \n",
    "Take a list of candidates and compare each of them to the rest of them. If 3 of 4 words match (75%), count this match as 1. All similes that match with other 5 similes are considered to be trite (5 is subjective; can put a higher num to get *really* trite similes; generally, the bigger the training set, the higher might be the number). Write all trite similes into a pkl-file. This is our collection. With a testing set, repeat all steps up to fuzzy matching. Then, instead of fuzzy matching candidates across the testing set, fuzzy match them with the trite similes collection. Output sentences that have a simile. For sents with trite simile - 'True', for sents with non-trite simile - 'False'.\n"

973,,in in opened in,Scott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with jazz-modern fluting as John Betjeman called it that when the Battersea A station was opened in 1934 it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century

981,,to,When the campanile is seen from a distance it seems to belong to some strange Expressionist church one has not noticed before
982,,cathedrals this,Not for nothing were such power stations described as brick cathedrals Bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition
983,,sound worth capable,But Bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which like the best mills of the Industrial Revolution is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use
984,,encouraged until with,Such re-use is of course much encouraged by a building being listed something which until recently was not possible with architecture of so recent a date

986,,home candidate submitted to included,Bracken House the former home of the Financial Times became the first candidate and English Heritage then submitted some 70 recommendations to the Department of the Environment these included Bankside
987,,This ready accept to approach in to Movement,This however was too much for the Government and using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings Lord Caithness the Minister of State for the Environment arbitrarily whittled down English Heritage 's list to 18 buildings excluding Bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the Fifties to the now-unfashionable Modern Movement
988,,this in way,However Caithness himself stated that this first selection was in no way a definitive list

993,,After stood,After two months ' silence I was informed that ministers stood by their decision
994,,asking this pointing out deserved,I wrote back asking the reasons for this pointing out that if any large modern power station deserved to be listed it was Bankside
995,,declines,Of course I know perfectly well why the Department of the Environment declines to list it
996,,full,Listed building procedures might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised
997,,has eyes on driving at astronomical,Furthermore British Rail has its eyes on the Bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for Channel traffic which it is so absurdly driving under the middle of London at astronomical cost
998,,in assessment,Listing in theory is an objective assessment of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition

1037,,before,I wrote it for you he assures his gal before the ballads but how can you tell
1038,,with these fails that with,All you can do with these songs is sing them and Buddy fails even to manage that with any subtlety
1039,,to pass muster Capital Gold down,The finales to both Acts are effectively concerts the sort of agreeably naff rock'n'roll revival that might just about pass muster as a Capital Gold one-nighter down the Hammersmith Palais
1040,,appeal comes out dull between,And for all the appeal of his singing and playing Paul Hipp comes out pretty dull between the numbers
1041,,camouflage failures,To camouflage the failures of the play Andy Walmsley has created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoardings Oldsmobile Van Heusen shirts Texaco Premium Type

1045,,true performance release suggests on wane,Was it true as the chart performance of Heartbeat his last release suggests that his three-year career was already on the wane
1046,,move with that,And surely any dramatist ought to be able to move us with that final night of Holly 's life when his musicians including Waylon Jennings gave their places on the plane to the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens
1047,,illustrated turn elements into,The author 's job is not merely to offer an illustrated Who 's Who entry but to turn elements of a man 's life into a dramatic entity

1055,,status dramatic this,The current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change
1056,,far risen from to over in broke,"Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera her reputation outside of Mexico now far supercedes his since 1919 sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sotheby 's New York for a Latin American artist"
1057,,enormous rise in in tandem with increased response to blend naive content,The enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content
1058,,wave arose with in led to,While the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen it was the publication of Hayden Herrera 's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status

1060,,In ran on spirit in,In May 1989 Elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the spirit of Mexico Fig. 1 while in Vogue Feb. 1990 there was a 10 page interpretation of the romance of Frida Kahlo 's Mexico Fig. 2
1061,,this blitz emerged in devotee based on,Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna already a devotee of Kahlo 's work was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo 's life
1062,,with mythical in focused on tragic,As with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlo 's admittedly fascinating life
1063,,with come dominate responses to,The passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera her flamboyant appearance but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work
1064,,helped deal with audiences allows access to,While Kahlo 's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art
1065,,In this draw parallels to appeal made generated,In this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death
1066,,icon s long,The archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990 s long hot summer
1067,,status tragic vibrant drive,Yet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh 's tragic life it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified his thick impasto brush-stroke his vibrant yellows the urgency of his creative drive
1068,,In image,In the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself the characteristic brows the elaborate hair the Mexican costume Fig. 3
1069,,formal language graced,It is primarily her appearance not the formal language of her art that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines
1070,,transposed to in balanced around segments,The Elle feature transposed the Kahlo style to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera 's biography of the artist
1071,,In piece far models,In the later Vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their Mexican interiors
1072,,in way on level served broken model,There is a poignant irony in the way clothing which on one level served to hide Kahlo 's broken body falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique Fig. 4
1073,,in from from,The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist from her work
1074,,In seen wider set about struggling against,In both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself exotic passionate yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit
1075,,line between hard draw in,Of course the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo 's case
1076,,grew from with,The majority of her work is self portraiture her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance

1078,,in Mask throws on reading revealing inner,More disturbingly in The Mask 1945 Fig. 7 she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions
1079,,Where mask fall ritual those features mask uncovers,Where does the mask fall Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features mask far more than it uncovers
1080,like,to appropriation constructed image poor cabbages naked,There is however an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933 some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress a la Mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible
1081,,impossibility stemmed from recognise to,The impossibility stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo 's choice of clothing a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances
1082,,attractiveness,The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde
1083,,choosing in powerful icon,For Kahlo however choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana as for example in Tree of Hope 1946 Fig. 8 was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity
1084,,from to,Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific varying from region to region
1085,,closest to forms,The Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-Hispanic forms of clothing
1086,,surrounding directed,It is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo 's choice
1087,,led to adoption image to hybrid,The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana in post-revolutionary Mexico as the image of the strong Indian woman the undefeated counterpart to the despised Chingada who conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico 's hybrid post-conquest culture
1088,,In where convey represents that aspect indigenous unbowed rule,In a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexico 's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule
1089,,adoption attractive disguise saw asserted position,Kahlo 's adoption of Tehuana dress while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position
1090,,In powerful mix these role come dominate to,In Kahlo 's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work
1091,,through movement evolved,It is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved
1092,,illustrates nature,Her work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman 's art
1093,,with between reveal site these mirror,The fascination with functions of the body the analogies between artistic and physical creative processes self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s

1983,,against about,He decided against telling Georgina about his meeting with Muldoon
1984,,This,This was n't it
1985,,This deals with approach to risks,This chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death
1986,,discussed here responds proportionately to degrees in where,Murder manslaughter and several other offences are discussed and one recurrent issue here is whether English law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused
1987,,culpable regarded serious in calendar,For practical purposes the culpable causing of another person 's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar
1988,,serious strikes at foundations rare serious form,There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence since it strikes at the very foundations of the State and its social organizations but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime
1989,,this find to degree,The reason for this is not difficult to find the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable
1990,,in leave retains,Even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects the victim retains his or her life and therefore the possibility of further pleasures and achievements whereas death is final
1991,,This makes regard serious on regard that in,This finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders in the absence of some excuse or justification
1992,,arise from from sees large amount to form in,Although many deaths arise from natural causes and many others from illnesses and diseases each year sees a large number of deaths caused by accidents and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in English law
1993,,show at,"For 1987 the statistics show that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths of which some 7,000 occurred in the home 6,000 at work and 5,000 on the roads"
1994,,includes,By comparison the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600 which includes all the murders and manslaughters
1995,,This small with that,This figure is relatively small when compared with many American cities but that is no cause for satisfaction
1996,,confronted,There are still awkward questions to be confronted
1997,,in culpable,For example are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all or even most of the deaths recorded as accidents
1998,,In pick out forms boundaries frozen,In other words does English criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters or are the boundaries frozen by tradition
1999,,wider in application to carry in spheres,Another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres
2000,,sweep large into creating designed,Thus even if it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as accidents into the law of homicide there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work safe goods safe buildings and so on
2001,,in spread net wider where greater,It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater
2002,,seen does this up to point in accept -defence departing from set out,It will be seen that English law does this up to a point and in the process seems to accept -defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in Chapter 3
2003,,distinguishes between have elements,English law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter as we shall see but the two crimes do have certain common elements
2004,,within,It must be proved that the defendant 's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day
2005,,in discussed elsewhere,The requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere
2006,,rule legacy substantial between pronounce on,The year and a day rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant 's conduct or some other event caused the death
2007,,reverse able determine -support in,Nowadays the problem is quite the reverse medical science is generally able to determine whether D's conduct caused the death and innovations such as -support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances
2008,,In half after kept on support,In one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after the incident having been kept on a support machine for almost the entire time
2009,,In in elements rule stands in way,In principle it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case if all the other elements can be established and only the year and a day rule stands in the way
2010,,rule in on ground left in,But the rule was confirmed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely
2011,,after,Surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event
2012,,rule out with,The rule itself is out accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished
2013,,DEFINING,DEFINING MURDER THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION
2014,,Context,a The Procedural Context
2015,,regarded serious follow form in highest imposed,If causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts
2016,,systems impose highest form called in that system,Indeed many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system
2017,,In this,In some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death
2018,,In those,In others such as those in the United Kingdom it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment
2019,,this at in,Why should this penalty be mandatory and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences
2020,,amounts to,One argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder
2021,,places under,It places the offender under the State 's control as it were for the remainder of his or her life
2022,,This linked with denounces with in declaring this,This is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible and with a supposed general deterrent effect in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime
2023,,makes substantial contribution,It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety
2024,,these strong,None of these arguments is notably strong let alone conclusive
2025,,serve mark out from refined capture remains discussed below,The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings and only the worst killings remains to be discussed below
2026,,regarded in on perception in blunted,Whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public 's perception of what life imprisonment means if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years ' imprisonment the effect will be somewhat blunted
2027,,to on calculations seen severe long fixed-,The same applies to the general deterrent argument its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers at all and if it does whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long fixed- sentence
2028,,this on fails take into account long,As for public protection this depends on executive decisions with regard to release it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep lifers in for so long
2029,,This brings discussion to point in,This brings the discussion to a crucial point what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice and what would be the alternative
2030,,Home on,What it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the Home Secretary on the advice of the Parole Board and the Lord Chief Justice rather than by the judge at the trial
2031,,In transfer upper limit on entrusts that to,In procedural terms therefore the life sentence involves a transfer of function normally it is the judge who determines the sentence or at least its upper limit since earlier release on parole may be possible whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge
2032,,bound those depart from,The Home Office is not bound by those opinions and appears to depart from them frequently
2033,,In Home on serving sadistic fixing these,In 1983 the Home Secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers terrorist killings murder during robbery and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children fixing a minimum of twenty years ' imprisonment for these offenders
2034,,introducing this serves underline in enacted without considered individually after from without,Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually after hearing representations from the offender 's counsel and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal
2035,,takes after long,At present the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods
2036,,those taken in way,Should those decisions not be taken by the courts in the same way as other sentencing decisions
2037,,given,The answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again
2038,,this persuasive discussed where reduced to wide,But this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility where a murder is reduced to manslaughter the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may according to the facts of the case select a determinate prison sentence a hospital order or life imprisonment
2039,,Those those has in in,Those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other
2040,,this led on,Considerations of this kind have led the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder
2041,,In place in mark,In its place would be a sentencing discretion which judges would use in many cases to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence
2042,,In where open spent taking gravity into account determined,In cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence the trial judge would still specify in open court the number of years to be spent in prison taking the gravity of the offence into account and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal
2043,,bring in without loss,Such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection
2044,,Degrees,b Degrees of Homicide
2045,,has degrees,English criminal law has two degrees of homicide murder and manslaughter
2046,,have degrees degree degree covering shades,Many American jurisdictions have three degrees of murder degree murder requiring premeditation and second- and degree murder covering lesser shades of culpability
2047,,with these leaving,In England there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions leaving a single offence of criminal homicide
2048,,That shift in from to stage in drawn at stage reflected in,That proposal if implemented would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone
2049,,have role in,The jury would have no role in most homicide cases since a plea of guilty would be the norm
2050,,this with position in where degrees to -degree bargain struck between succeed in reduce degree,Contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide pleas of guilty to first- and -degree murders would be less frequent since there would be the possibility of argument in court if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing
2051,,borderlines between degrees raise,Moreover the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals
2052,,labelled in refined way at cost bills,The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills
2053,,That cost where capital degree,That cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for degree murder
2054,,Where degrees have calls careful weighing labelling against cost mobilised,Where there is no capital punishment however the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling see Chapter 3.3 l against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration see Chapter 3.3 m
2055,,structure,The structure of the English law of homicide is rather strange
2056,,includes distinct defined,Although there are two offences murder and manslaughter the latter includes two distinct varieties voluntary manslaughter killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstances and involuntary manslaughter killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability
2057,,tend focus on,The arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions What is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder
2058,,reduce,What conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter
2059,,In,In English criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
2060,,these,What do these requirements mean
2061,,extend far narrow,Do they extend the definition of murder too far or are they too narrow
2062,,regarded form element to extent that on,Intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder but to some extent that depends on the meaning of intent
2063,,This subject clear settled,This has been the subject of a number of House of Lords decisions and yet the definition is still not clear and settled
2064,,charged follow from that,Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission
2065,,In this way regarded part suggesting from,In this way both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or virtual certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred
2066,,this applied,How would this test be applied
2067,,without full,In many cases the word intent is used without elaboration but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary
2068,,set where had against,A fairly typical set of facts is provided by Nedrick 1986 where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to burn her out
2069,,set,One night he went to her house poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door and set it alight
2070,,defence this claim put to,A defence of this kind a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm requires the full definition to be put to the jury
2071,,to,The question is granted that D's purpose was to frighten did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone
2072,,this drawing from in from surrounding,The jury should answer this by drawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances
2073,,about element in,What about the alternative element in the definition an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
2074,,This has this,This has considerable practical importance since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder
2075,,shown includes to,It must be shown that the defendant intended which again includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty to cause really serious injury to someone
2076,,confirmed this rule in from,The House of Lords confirmed this rule in Cunningham 1981 D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair causing injuries from which the victim died a week later
2077,,maintained throughout from,D maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill but there was evidence from which the jury could infer and did infer that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm
2078,,upheld serious without contemplated,The House of Lords upheld D 's conviction for murder an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder without any proof that the defendant intended or even contemplated the possibility that death would result
2079,,rule extend far,Does the grievous bodily harm rule extend the definition of murder too far
2080,,point from mark out rule draws line low,If the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction it can be argued that the grievous bodily harm rule draws the line too low
2081,,rule it departs from element in to that,In terms of principle the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence see Chapter 5.2(a) namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime
2082,,allowing violating turning serious into constructive,By allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction the law is violating a general principle turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime
2083,,construct this,Why should it be necessary to construct a murder conviction out of this lesser intent
2084,,this final significant between sets out,There are arguments in favour of this death is final murder is the gravest crime and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill
2085,,in that on on on on range,No one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death that may depend on the victim 's physique on the speed of an ambulance on the distance from the hospital and on a range of other medical and individual matters
2086,,serious to show wanton label,If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label murder if death results
2087,,uphold breach that amplitude lies beneath includes put at,The counter-arguments which would uphold the principle of correspondence are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim 's life at risk
2088,,In leading gave that serious,In the leading case of Cunningham Lord Edmund-Davies dissenting gave the example of breaking someone 's arm that is a really serious injury but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim 's life
2089,,in rule goes further protagonists support,So in practice the grievous bodily harm rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support
2090,,confine element in to,Would it be right then to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill
2091,,That have strike note,That would have the merit of simplicity but would it strike the right note socially
2092,,powerful where where to that in,There are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill can not be established and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings
2093,,about label that drawing line between,Of course one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label murder because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter which is not susceptible of any precise resolution
2094,,hard smaller larger follows,It is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows it is a question of social judgment
2095,,consider,Let us briefly consider some of the possibilities
2096,,element serious this,The fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness why should this not suffice for murder
2097,,in serious,The question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term murder
2098,,given taking in opposite labelled,One answer sometimes given is that they are not because a driver who overtakes on a bend knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue
2099,,This assumes with overwhelm to,This example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis
2100,,in taking with,One might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people 's lives
2101,,modified at slight in these labelled in way,Yet if the example is modified a little so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings
2102,,This,This is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently
2103,,point taking with taking slight serious,The point is rather that even though knowingly taking risks with other people 's lives is usually unjustifiable taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death
2104,,In discussing boundaries with,In discussing the boundaries of murder we are concerned with classification not exculpation
2105,,broad point remains,To classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings
2106,,line drawn here,Can a satisfactory line be drawn here
2107,,approach draw line to degree,One approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability
2108,,in those situations where,Murder is committed in those situations where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result
2109,,this high introduced into in,A version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other European countries it was introduced into English law by the decision in Hyam v.
2110,,abandoned in on grounds,DPP 1975 but abandoned in Moloney 1985 on grounds of uncertainty
2111,,approach frame in way make clear make on,A second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct
2112,,Section Model includes within those extreme to value,Section 210.2 of the Model Penal Code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest extreme indifference to the value of human life
2113,,treats with wicked directs to,Scots law treats as murder killings with wicked recklessness a phrase which directs the court 's attention to the circumstances of the killing
2114,,Model reduced to extreme wicked wicked extreme,Both the Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced to circularity however for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be the only possible answer is wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction
2115,,Model contain amount to extreme assists increases in way essence approaches way those,Admittedly the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings
2116,,protagonists from labelling opponents here reduce on background,Their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the courts opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors such as distaste for the defendant 's background allegiance or other activities
2117,,formulation derives from in in those situations where serious with,A third more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 namely that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death
2118,,on restrict producing satisfies marks out,Neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own but together they restrict one another producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but non-intended killings
2119,,approach adopted law until in force in form course,A fourth approach adopted by English law until 1957 and still in force in many American jurisdictions is some form of felony-murder rule anyone who kills during the course of a felony or more restrictively a serious crime of violence or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder
2120,,to serious held grounds placing in highest,Thus stated there is no reference to the defendant 's intention or awareness of the risks the fact that D has chosen to commit rape robbery or another serious offence and has caused death thereby is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category
2121,,this form constructive constructed ingredients,Plainly this is a form of constructive criminal liability the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredients of a lesser offence
2122,,crossed high threshold in serious held,Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue however unforeseeable they may be
2123,,reduced in serious,The objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required in other words if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness as to death
2124,,that those substantial,The effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when D had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability and to classify them as murder
2125,,approaches,Four alternative approaches have been described and many others could be listed
2126,,point focused mark out those,The point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not of themselves appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous
2127,,resort to identify separate out,The law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings
2128,,covered,Some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers others would be terrorists
2129,,had that,The armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim and that it went off accidentally if the jury believes that should he be convicted of murder

2635,,These related,These do not have to be biologically related organisms
2636,,closely to,The basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function
2637,,these ferocious habits with at,Sometimes these similarities are quite obvious the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores
2638,,in in opposing co-operate in in unrelated on,But the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals in which opposing teeth co-operate in action and which can be matched in extinct unrelated mammals is a much more subtle matter involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones
2639,,hunt defy with stand up to,The technique of hunt the analogue is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists but it is certainly not a foolproof one because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny
2640,,in way jobs perform,If the fossil is constructed in a certain way then there are only a limited number of jobs that the structure could perform
2641,,here,The idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one
2642,,This assumes manufactures designs,This assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs
2643,,this make,For the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make
2644,,today accord with flyers swimmers,Most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive flyers are aerodynamically efficient active swimmers have suitable streamlining herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food and so on
2645,,these in where pursued this far,Ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited
2646,,answer reached,Of course it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached unless somebody dredges up a living fossil from the depths of the ocean there are only varying degrees of probability
2647,,answers obtained where design points to habits where consistent with in,But the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur
2648,,at occupying niches ways with wide in show,Since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches >behaving in different ways corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show
2649,,above these occupations get glimpse,We can use the methods described above to elucidate some of these occupations and get a glimpse albeit an imperfect one of the trilobite as it lived
2650,,take where where point in direction answer,I will take an example where all the methods can be used and where all point in the same direction so that the answer is probably correct
2651,,occupy,Most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide not greatly convex and with eyes that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head
2652,,below,There are a few trilobite species however with enormous globular eyes see below

2656,,take,We can take the eyes first
2657,,made up,The trilobite eye was of a compound type and each lens was made up of a calcite crystal
2658,,From this able interpret coming from at to,From the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface
2659,,field our at in,So we can deduce what the field of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite was by looking at the directions in which all the lenses face
2660,,turns out our able in line,It turns out that our animal was able to see in almost every direction upwards downwards sideways and forwards and even backwards because the eyes bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body
2661,,field,Most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field of view
2662,,suspect habitually,If the animal lived on the sea bottom it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor
2663,,consistent with this,Other features of its shape are consistent with this
2664,,these point at,At the – edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines and these point downwards at a steep angle at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor
2665,,with,The thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite compare Fig. 33
2666,,operated this shows,The convex middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages which as usual are not preserved and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful
2667,,this suggests,The construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom and possibly in the surface waters of the sea
2668,,find direct this look modifications,Of course because there are no living trilobites we can not find direct confirmation of this hypothesis but we can look for other arthropods that have the same modifications of the eyes for example in the present day oceans
2669,like,found in has headlamps with relatives above,The analogy is found in such ocean-going amphipods a kind of shrimp as Cystosoma which also has enormously expanded eyes looking like headlamps compared with its bottom-dwelling relatives see above

2720,,preferred,Most bottom-dwelling trilobites preferred to live at a particular water depth or on a particular type of sea bottom mud sand or lime
2721,,to our found with without,No such restriction should apply to our large-eyed species it should be found with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without preference
2722,,This found with,This has been proved in several places in some arctic localities it is found with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the Ordovician ocean while in Canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas where limestones were accumulating
2723,,token have barrier to,By the same token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution for oceans would be no barrier to it
2724,,this our now,And again this proves to be the case our example is found in Arctic Canada in the high Arctic island of Spitsbergen thousands of miles away in what is now the desert country of Nevada and Utah in the United States in western Ireland in Russia and in northwestern Australia
2725,,in this sources point in direction from way constructed with with from,So in this case the different sources of evidence all point in the same direction whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed or by analogy with living animals with similar adaptations or from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils
2726,,These swimmers near,These giant-eyed trilobites of the Ordovician were active swimmers in the surface waters as near certainly as we can ever know
2727,,about habits these careful,There are all kinds of different questions we can ask about the life habits of these trilobites which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny
2728,,in,Because we do not have the legs preserved it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in feeding and neither are the stomach contents preserved
2729,,here,So here there are only more or less likely speculations
2730,,swimmers present on had harvesting large,Active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food
2731,,after in have,Or they may have been hunters after larger prey in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food
2732,,Puzzles remain,Puzzles remain even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story
2733,,AMONG,CONTROVERSY AMONG THE GIANT DINOSAURS
2734,,seen present in habits from,The giant sauropod dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus were the largest land animals the world has seen they weighed more than 80 tonnes and present quite different problems in the interpretation of their life habits from the diminutive trilobites
2735,,attracted,Such spectacular animals have obviously attracted much attention and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago
2736,,showing giants,Most of the popular books showing the Mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation their bodies largely under water
2737,,this,Surely an animal of this bulk it was argued must be partly supported by water and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps
2738,,habits giants looked at in way disproves,Recently the life habits of the giants have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notions
2739,,structure,Consider the structure of their legs
2740,,pillar- those,The sauropods have relatively long pillar- legs resembling those of the elephant the largest living land animal and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal
2741,,speaking tend,The feet of the sauropod are small relatively speaking with short stubby toes yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly
2742,,see avoid,It is difficult to see how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft muddy bottom of a lake
2743,,after allow,If the dinosaur did after all live on dry land then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees see p. 116
2744,,from allies,There is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that Diplodocus and its allies moved about in herds
2745,,with in this sited had,They may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull with the nostrils in this case sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort
2746,,balance swinging away from to habits,The balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits
2747,,aspects habits strongly,But other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated
2748,,In powerful arisen over in this,In the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded like all living reptiles and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles or warm-blooded resembling mammals in this respect
2749,,warm up that in climates,Cold-blooded animals have to warm up before they can be fully active that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates
2750,,this cope with having extended,For this reason they can not cope with climates having greatly extended winters
2751,,have at continuously use far,Warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times and can be more continuously active but they use far more energy and hence need more food than cold-blooded animals of the same size
2752,,posture with,The posture of many dinosaurs and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs was fully erect with the legs beneath the body and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles see p. 116
2753,,hunters,The long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance see p. 116
2754,,On hand with through with allow continuous,On the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so large and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller living reptiles
2755,,giants support,It has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy
2756,,armoured plated armour this,The armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded
2757,,about habits giants in in,One idea about the life habits of the dinosaur giants published in Joc and Colette at the Natural History Museum in 1935
2758,,warm-blooded tend with about,The warm-blooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs
2759,,This close,This is that the dinosaurs or a close dinosaur relative included the ancestors of the living birds
2760,,about passing between reconstruction shows,Some of the smaller and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that shows fleet-footed running dinosaurs
2761,,point closely,The point is that birds themselves are warm-blooded like mammals and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely related as now seems likely then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded
2762,,pros cons this subject say greater,The pros and cons of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by experts but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs including small and large carnivores were warm-blooded active animals
2763,,lot among on these about this makes dry layman,A lot of the argument among the authorities on these animals is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons and particularly the Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx this makes for rather dry reading for the layman
2764,,end- accurate reconstruction world over,But the end- is the accurate reconstruction of the Jurassic and Cretaceous terrestrial world over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant

2774,,on tide at slackening pace growth fuelled remove,The 1964 Labour Government was elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform but also of optimism that little more than economic growth fuelled by technological change was needed to remove the main causes of urban deprivation MacGregor 1981

2901,,taken central argues link between disorder set,Although the Scarman Report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between social conditions and disorder the terms of the debate were by no means set by Scarman
2902,,vigorous exchanges took place in in about role played in,During both April and July 1981 vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in Parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots

2909,,number roots noted in in this received,While a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the United States have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests Skolnick 1969 Fogelson 1971 Edelman 1971 Knopf 1975 this issue has received relatively little attention in Britain

2919,,PERSPECTIVES ON,PERSPECTIVES ON THE 1985 RIOTS
2920,,in scale,Despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981 the scale and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators
2921,,presented before,Handsworth for example was presented even shortly before September 1985 as a success story in terms of police community relations
2922,,this presented,The outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration

2926,,found in acted against forms blamed on,The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980–1 had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people

2951,,number imagery run this found in in on,A number of stories using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates Hansard vol. 84 21 October 1985 cols. 30-.46 388 and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in Birmingham and London
2952,,inner conceived breeding ground disorderly hard break link between two forced take on board restore order through through,The cities of inner despair were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest and however hard the Government tried to break the causal link between the two it was forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities

2954,,on heavily in denied through pursuit free-market,The Government 's record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of free-market policies
2955,,find way link between without bringing into linking growth disorder to,But the Government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs
2956,,emphasis on acts in responses to took form,The emphasis on crime and the criminal acts of the rioters in the official responses to the 1985 riots took a general and a specific form
2957,,form relied on form against act cry loot,The general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police but a criminal act or a cry for loot
2958,,This put,This was an argument put most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear Chief Constable of the West Midlands Dear 1985 and by Douglas Hurd the Home Secretary in relation to Handsworth
2959,,in responses to,But it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots
2960,,form built upon saw,The specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in Handsworth and Brixton in particular was brought about by drug barons who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control their territory
2961,,this line found in on in,Numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in Dear 's report on Handsworth and in press coverage during the riots
2962,,Taking about role in this served,Taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and drug barons in stimulating the riots this seems to have served two purposes
2963,,distanced from grievances linked to locating outside in barons loot,First it distanced the riots from the social economic political and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the social problems of inner-city dwellers and in the simple greed of the drug barons to accumulate loot
2964,,image at level,Second just as Dear 's image of a few hundred young black criminals was used to explain what happened in Handsworth the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level
2965,,image through saturation around depoliticize,The issue of drugs provided an everyday image already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate around which the police the Home Office and other institutions could depoliticize the riots
2966,,to moved forcibly senseless reflected on in on in took place on echoes picked up on cry cry loot,Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night the echoes of which I picked up on Tuesday was not a cry for help but a cry for loot Financial Times 13 September 1985
2967,,took this further pointing out before taken place with support,The Chief Constable for the West Midlands Geoffrey Dear took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place with the support of local community leaders

2972,,contains elements,While such notions may all contains some elements of truth they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour
2973,,This examine range attempt,This chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour
2974,,covered in introductions to to embarking upon,Although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific substantive examples of criminal behaviour
2975,,this on follows brief wide range,As this is not a book on criminological theories what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theories and explanations
2976,,in order,First a word of warning might be in order
2977,,uncover extensive encompassed,It would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime
2978,,this poor raise in poor,Perhaps this was because of their poor living conditions which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing
2979,,this poor,Was this because of governmental housing policy or a poor employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family
2980,,Clearly getting further further away from looking at,Clearly we are getting further and further away from the causes of delinquent behaviour and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour
2981,,on to from outside of from,Before examining the major sociological on crime it is useful to refer to theories from outside of sociology from other academic disciplines
2982,,look at,Thus we will look initially at biological and psychological theories
2983,,based on to make-up,Biological or physiological explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up
2984,,this put down to patterns hereditary,The individual criminal is born so and this is usually put down to faulty chromosome patterns or more vaguely to hereditary traits
2985,,this approach,The most famous exponent of this approach was the nineteenth-century Italian physician Cesare Lombroso
2986,,In called in,In his book L'Uomo Delinquente Lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the born criminal who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics in particular facial characteristics for example large jaws and ears and high cheek bones
2987,,illustrate,In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate Lombroso 's theory
2988,,arches solitary orbits handle sessile found in savages acute,Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws high cheek bones prominent superciliary arches solitary lines on the palms extreme size of the orbits handle or sessile ears found in criminals savages and apes insensibility of pain extremely acute sight tattooing excessive idleness love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake
2989,,These see prone to,These explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent
2990,,based on,Lombroso 's work for example was based on his examination of people in prison in Italy
2991,,This ignore,This would necessarily ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison and that perhaps people in prison are not always criminal
2992,,advocates express in relics died with,Most advocates of biological theories do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style as Lombroso and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics that died with Lombroso
2993,,In in form in found with,In a major study of institutionalised delinquents delinquents in some form of custody in the USA in the 1950s Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build a chunky muscular compared with non-delinquent boys
2994,,restricted to association between,However the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency
2995,,tougher to put away fragile,It may be that tougher delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones
2996,,found association between on hand on other reduced background taken into account,Furthermore it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social background factors are taken into account
2997,,lower this found in,For example lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics
2998,,links between inherited suggesting association between,With regard to the links between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristics there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristics
2999,,this sophisticated approach in link between,An example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of Hans Eysenck who has argued in a series of studies that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour
3000,,maintains link between,He maintains that there is a link between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour
3001,,degree inherited determined make-up,An individual 's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited determined by his or her genetic make-up
3002,,link with found found in,The link with crime found by Eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion more extroverts were found than in the general population
3003,,inherited,Eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour
3004,,with above with assumed in,As with Lombroso 's work and the Gluecks ' study discussed above by starting with institutionalised criminals it is assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do in fact go to prison
3005,,picture,The people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture of all criminals
3006,,faced suggesting link between make-up between,The major problem faced by theories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects
3007,,inherited,While some genetic influence can not be ruled out just what is inherited remains very unclear
3008,,These share with,These theories share certain similarities with biological explanations
3009,,stress link between,They stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics
3010,,see these inherited,Psychological theories however see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences rather than as inherited
3011,,with seen looked at from point view,Thus as with biological theories crime is seen as pathological a disease as something to be looked at from the medical point of view
3012,,mark,However psychological causes are seen as treatable whereas biological causes mark the individual for life
3013,,In those,In those cases there is no possible treatment one is born a criminal
3014,,refer to in having on,Many psychological theories refer to faulty parent-child relationships such as abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality
3015,,in this area indicated strict lax attitudes found close,Studies in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitudes increase the risk of delinquency the work of John Bowlby for example they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationships with parents or parent figures then problem behaviour is more common
3016,,in lax,It is well established that in the delinquent-prone home discipline is more liable to be too lax strict or erratic
3017,,this explain patterns,However it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children and this fact can hardly be used to explain present patterns of crime
3018,,disturbed broken broken produce,The majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes and many broken homes do not produce delinquents
3019,,this point show link between,Of course this last point does not show that there is no link between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency
3020,,with assessing dimensions weak closely linked to aspects poor,The problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions such as weak supervision or parental criminality is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage such as poverty overcrowding and poor housing
3021,,these hamper,And it may be that these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties and hamper good parenting
3022,,to wide here,We can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing
3023,,These stress conclude from,These stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years and conclude that anti-social and by implication criminal behaviour results from faulty personality development
3024,,these hold rest with toward,To summarise these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour
3025,,based on inherited,They are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique individual experiences
3026,,look at feel,Before we look at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself or to discuss with colleagues whether you feel that criminals are different types of person
3027,,toward inherited these,While there are no doubt predispositions toward criminal behaviour and clearly certain characteristics are inherited most sociologists would reject these individual pathology sort of theories
3028,,supporting,They lack convincing supporting evidence
3029,,from vast,While some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not
3030,,follows large,Furthermore if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal
3031,,shown high in high,For numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences in particular high proportions of juveniles and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal
3032,,above,We said above that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime
3033,,This incomplete,This is not because such explanations are wrong but because they are incomplete or inadequate
3034,,In stressed considered context on on reaction to,In Chapter One it was stressed that crime can not be considered aside from its social context that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal and on the reaction of others to such actions
3035,,Applications,Potential Applications
3036,,extent to applications consider in depth application fields,Given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application fields
3037,,In examine extent to on in these fields context governs extent to,In the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes
3038,,Questions on heavily on sources,Questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources
3039,,In situations this provisions governing access format exert powerful on made these,In situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data
3040,,in this part examine to handling applications fields,The first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling in terms of four potential applications fields
3041,,state art in fields with to make on,The authors were asked to review the current state of the art in their fields with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make on geographic information management
3042,,state consider impact on handling,Authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology
3043,,In this way in this part present perspectives amplify discussion in part,In this way the chapters in this part present a number of perspectives which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part
3044,,In this tackled from in part viewed in,In this case however methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right
3045,,summarizes features this,Figure 8.1 summarizes the main features of this matrix
3046,,between in this part in nature make on in attached to in these fields,There are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields
3047,,dealing with applications make wide range,The first three chapters dealing with environmental monitoring natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications make use of a very wide range of geographic information
3048,,feature these applications extent to overlays drawn from sources on base,A major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base
3049,,this make heavy on size structures,for this reason they make particularly heavy demands on current GIS technology both because of the size of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures that are involved
3050,,on discusses application field where collected derived from sources,Brown 's chapter on geodemographics discusses an application field where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from sources such as the Census of Population
3051,,range made on in applications this those applications fields,The range of data sets involved and the demands that are made on GIS technology in applications of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications fields
3052,,this made on modelling,However this is offset by the demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology
3053,,on discusses role in on scale in context identified in,Rhind 's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the Brundtland report
3054,,points to impact have on sectors,It points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the UK economy
3055,,This contribution indicates wide in change draws to role playing in co-ordinating these,This contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the European Community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these efforts
3056,,in progress discusses part,One of the examples of work in progress discusses research that has been carried out for the European Commission as part of the CORINE Project
3057,,This highlights challenges in field standards in high,This highlights the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries varying definitions and standards in use and unreasonably high user expectations
3058,,draws to in,The chapter as a whole draws attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction
3059,,These include nature capacity this based extracting from,These include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of based inference machines for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data
3060,,whole,As a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the Member States and often several groups within each one databases of topography soils water resources and quality biotopes atmospheric emissions climate soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole Community and can be interrelated other data sets such as land cover derived from satellite imagery have already been compiled for some of the Member States
3061,,whole,To achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact
3062,,whole,Conceptually what is offered is little more than an automated sieve mapping that land-use planners have used for many years but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using GIS software
3063,,consider at from from from,We should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances from toxic air pollution from flooding and so on
3064,,make assessments about resources deploy in high made,Such data are crucial either for assisting the emergency services to make assessments about resources they need to deploy in such events or for high estimates to be made of risk
3065,,Within domain on from lowest level that,Within the public domain in the UK we must rely in general on data from the most recent Population Census the lowest level being that for enumeration districts EDs
3066,,these on,As is well known Rhind 1983 these contain on average perhaps 150–200 households and 400–500 people
3067,,boundaries higher,The boundaries EDs have not been widely digitized unlike the higher electoral wards
3068,,grid,However the centroids of EDs are available as 100 m grid references and artificial ED polygons can be created if necessary
3069,,In in,In some instances such data will suffice in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available
3070,,scales at coarse assessments,Furthermore the scales at which population estimates are often required means that even EDs are too coarse for risk assessments
3071,,in assessments deal with offer resolution accurate made,For instance in performing its quantitative risk assessments the Health and Safety Executive will rarely deal with distances from hazardous sites in excess of 1 km Petts 1988 and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimates to be made
3072,,pointed out uses grid from in,It should be pointed out however that the National Radiological Protection Board currently uses 1 km grid square resolution population data from the 1971 Census in its radiological protection studies Hallam et al. 1981
3073,,consider in,It would seem that despite the costs involved they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data Pinpoint Address Code PAC provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd
3074,,This area application market,This area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product
3075,,exercise in deriving assessments this,A useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and PAC data in deriving quantitative risk assessments and this is an interesting research problem
3076,,with assumptions made about made,Even with PAC data some assumptions would need to be made about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made
3077,,consider large planning this area ripe,More generally we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiatives
3078,,lagging behind in construction on those releases,In the UK we seem to be lagging well behind the USA in the construction of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those involving toxic releases
3079,what they term,in on construct microinventory plants plants,For instance Lioy and Daisey 1987 in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in New Jersey construct what they term a microinventory for each of three towns comprising the locations of chemical plants metal processing plants paint spray manufacturers and so on
3080,,these,Some attribute information is available for these
3081,,closely linked to inventory,More closely linked to GIS is work by McMaster and Johnson 1986 who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous materials both stored and transported in Santa Monica California
3082,,displays crude within,Although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people for instance particular age groups within certain distances of toxic hazard sites
3083,,have on those regulated approach adopted in search associations with,We have data on some hazardous sites e.g. those regulated by CIMAH in the UK but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted especially if we are serious in the search for environmental associations with chronic diseases
3084,,releases,The same is true for toxic releases
3085,,produces has recording releases include released release,In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency produces an Acute Hazards Events Database while the Department of Transportation has a database recording details of 25 000 releases of toxic materials such details include locational information type and amount of material released mode of release and resulting injuries or deaths Cutter and Solecki 1989
3086,,construct mosaics at scales to,Can we not use GIS technology to construct risk mosaics Zeigler et al. 1983 at a variety of spatial scales akin to Hewitt and Burton 's hazardousness of a place
3087,,handful planning built up resource in form this,In the UK only a handful of county emergency planning departments Cumbria for instance have built up resource databases in digital form and this needs to be promoted
3088,,Further afield recognize have take place with co-ordination,Further afield we need to recognize that some disasters most obviously Chernobyl will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination
3089,,assessment planning,There will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment and planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries or at sea and airports
3090,,above step in this direction links forged between,As noted above the work of Fedra 1989 is a major step in this direction and links need to be forged between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe
3091,,on drawn to plans prepared,In terms of databases on hazardous wastes attention has already been drawn to the waste disposal plans prepared by WRAs
3092,,These give on closed,These give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes though little or no information on closed and abandoned sites
3093,,consulted,However for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted
3094,,operated large on with,The former Hazardous Waste Inspectorate operated a large database on all sites with details of permitted wastes including allowable quantities
3095,,repository at scale above,OPCS of course is a major data repository for medical statistics and their various Monitor Series are of use though only at the scale of district health authority and above see Gatrell and Lovett 1988 for an example
3096,,produce at level,Regional health authorities will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level
3097,,obtain from these valuable,However if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registries these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable
3098,,have,The data are postcoded and may have some occupational details
3099,,from between,For example we have received data from the Regional Cancer Registry in Manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between 1974 and 1984
3100,,This large set to grid about,This large data set to which grid references have now been added comprises information about nearly 40 000 individuals
3101,,copied into system permitting made about subsets between from,It has now been copied into INGRES a relational database management system permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data for instance all males between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer
3102,,sources on,Other data sources on cancers are independent registries of malignancies
3103,,that on Centre,An example is that on leukaemias managed by the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre in Leeds Alexander et al. 1989
3104,,noted between receive directly from,It should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants
3105,,directly in gaining access to high,Indeed working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to high morbidity data
3106,,sources worth mentioning,Two other potential sources of data are worth mentioning
3107,,drawn to from to,First attention should be drawn to the new directive from the Department of Health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population
3108,,This in charged with presenting,This means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report presenting and interpreting epidemiological data identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes
3109,,heavily in this,Lancaster University is already heavily involved in the work of Preston District Health Authority in this area
3110,,take on these roles from viewpoint,Second family health service authorities FHSAs are also required to take on these roles but from the viewpoint of primary health care services
3111,,to to hold large on,FHSAs which correspond to non-metropolitan counties and to metropolitan boroughs hold large databases on services provided by general practitioners for instance uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers
3112,,contemplate these sources form System parallel that,Is it we wonder possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a National Online Health Information System NOHIS to parallel that for employment and unemployment Townsend et al. 1987
3113,,This include on at level,This might include data on morbidity and mortality uptake of preventative medicine service use and availability at both primary and hospital level
3114,,tool taking place in,It would be a useful management tool particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the National Health Service
3115,,have domain,It should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the UK to develop public domain databases
3116,,prone,Are there prone areas
3117,,in,Is there a regional differentiation in hazard type
3118,,These questions deal going into collection,These are of course commercially important questions and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance companies
3119,,Assessment,One well known database is Major Hazard Incident Data Service MHIDAS global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the Safety and Reliability Directorate on behalf of the Major Hazards Assessment Unit of the UK Health and Safety Directorate
3120,,This system runs in contains items assessed on into fields,This system currently runs in dBASE II and contains in excess of 3000 items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields
3121,,poor with this,Unfortunately the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied
3122,,entered into field after this,It is for example little use when recording a chemical spill into an Egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field the Nile after all this river is some 6480 km long
3123,,Here in view input rendering value,Here in our view is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value
3124,,In found way into,In some cases good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a GIS
3125,,in point,A case in point is inland and coastal flooding
3126,,showing return,Most river authorities have detailed maps showing the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return periods
3127,,Within massive in this area,Within the next decade as the privatized water companies develop their GIS we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area
3128,,This with models allow sophisticated models within framework,This development together with the availability of digital terrain models will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting models to be developed within a GIS framework
3129,,in this,As sea-levels rise in the next 20–30 years due to the greenhouse effect this very practical use of GIS technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance
3130,,way in rapprochement between in area sampling from samples,Another way in which there needs to be a rapprochement between statistical methods and GIS is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples
3131,,This in discussion above implies,This is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion of RIMNET above implies
3132,,on,As an example Peirson 1988 has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in Cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces
3133,,point worth making here from point,The point worth making here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point data Lam 1983
3134,,part offers,One method in particular kriging now available as part of the UNIRAS software offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map
3135,,this high suggests sampling,Where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up
3136,,in application to vigorously in,Such techniques are now standard in environmental science see Streit 1981 for an application to rainfall monitoring and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard studies Estes et al. 1987
3137,,Related to this that making from overlay operations,Related to this problem is that of making population estimates for new zones that result from overlay operations
3138,,within plumes fixed,We may want to count numbers living within plumes circles of fixed radius buffer zones and so on
3139,,base on shares slicing in assigned half that source,Existing GIS techniques usually base the estimates on area-weighted shares so that a new polygon created by slicing an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit
3140,,This in,This may be quite absurd in some cases notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ED
3141,,At modelling package interfaced with,At the NWRRL work is under way Flowerdew and Green 1989 to solve such problems using the EM algorithm and the statistical modelling package GLIM which has been interfaced with ARC/INFO
3142,,Operations,Operations research methods and simulation
3143,,in linking models to applications operations to,While there is some research activity in linking statistical models to GIS there would seem to be scope for further applications of operations research techniques to GIS problems
3144,,Within sophisticated shortest path failed links between operations,Within some sophisticated GIS such as ARC/INFO there are some useful algorithms such as shortest path calculations but GIS developers have in general failed to realize the natural links between GIS functions and many operations research techniques
3145,,Over large tools solution with planning,Over the last 20 years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning Kolesar 1981
3146,,include dictate,The choice of locations need not be for permanent bases but can also include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate Kolesar and Walker 1974
3147,,In assignment resources to,In any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resources to demands
3148,,resources held at at resources,If resources are held at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known how do we allocate the resources most efficiently
3149,,In held at,In a major emergency for example there might be a need to supply blood products held at regional blood banks to hospitals
3150,,This solution,This of course is the classic transportation problem and its solution is well known
3151,,far based response system this,As far as we know the based emergency response system devised by Belardo et al. 1983 is the only GIS-like software to incorporate this algorithm
3152,,In this system solution to,In this system the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network which is displayed on the computer screen
3153,,role operations in faced mentioned,As a last example of the potential role of operations research in GIS and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced the Peel Regional Police Force during the Mississauga evacuation mentioned previously Scanlon and Padgham 1980
3154,,states facing make,During the early states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make ready for evacuation
3155,,essence,Speed was of the essence and manpower was limited
3156,,Here operations network,Here then is a familiar operations research network problem all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length/time is a minimum
3157,so-called,This Chinese postman problem with travelling salesman problem route through network nodes,This is the so-called Chinese postman problem which provides a Hamiltonian circuit through the arcs as compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network nodes

3162,shaped,in soft light boxy line face,This one was in soft light green with a boxy shaped jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line the jacket and face the wide reveres
3163,,raw materials before spotted,The raw materials might have been there before indeed had n't it been she Arlene who had spotted them
3164,,filly into racehorse,But the transformation of a leggy young filly into a sleekly beautiful racehorse had been her doing
3165,,on model circuit eliminated trace,eighteen months on the model circuit had eliminated all trace of her former Somerset accent
3166,,to imitating held in highest,She had listened to Arlene 's own voice and set about imitating it for she held her mentor in the highest esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her
3167,,expanding from into big putting on,The House of Mattli is expanding from couture into ready-to-wear and one of the big Bristol stores Taylors are putting on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new prêt-è-porter ' Arlene explained
3168,,amongst top in,The House of Mattli was a husband and wife team who were numbered amongst the top ten names in the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers
3169,,to capital,Furthermore Madame Mattli was a Frenchwoman an accident of birth which added to her glamour for was not Paris the fashion capital of the world

3176,,with air,Madame Mattli was almost exactly as Paula had imagined she would be a petite perfectly turned out woman with an air of chic that was unmistakably French
3177,,dark -streaked in relieved,Her dark -streaked hair which she wore in a long bob had been cut by Vidal Sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved only by a little white flounce at the neckline
3178,like,over creations mother hen on,In the fitting rooms at Taylors she fussed and fretted over her creations like a mother hen and though Paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her on sight
3179,as,with generous helping tight-coiled spring explode into kind deep perceptive,Madame Mattli might be a stickler for detail with a generous helping of the artistic temperament which kept her tight-coiled as a spring and which would explode into frenzy if the smallest detail was not as it should be but she also had a kind face and deep perceptive eyes
3180,,through revived,Half way through the day 's programme of shows while the dressers went off to grab a sandwich and the model girls who would not dare to eat while they were showing revived themselves with cups of black coffee Madame Mattli took Paula to one side
3181,,turned somersault,Paula 's stomach turned a somersault
3182,,directly,I have been watching you work Madame Mattli said directly
3183,,that warmed to,Her accent reminded Paula of Louise perhaps that was why she warmed to her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring

3189,,looking,I believe you are exactly what I am looking for
3190,,lifting corner,Over Madame Mattli 's shoulder Paula could see Arlene watching her a tiny smile lifting one corner of her scarlet mouth and Paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she was thinking
3191,,lose models reflected glory came from model,She did not want to lose Paula who was one of her best models but already she was enjoying the reflected glory that came from having personally trained a house model for one of the great London couture houses
3192,,about to,She had known about the vacancy at Mattli and hoped that the job might be offered to Paula
3193,,seal,It was the seal of approval for her own judgement

3195,,present model at end jump at,My present house model leaves at the end of the month and there are plenty of girls who would jump at the chance
3196,,make move without giving,But all the same I could n't make such a move without giving it some thought Paula said grandly
3197,,bubbling with,But inside she was bubbling with excitement

3753,,trembling with,Her fingers trembling with excitement she fastened it around her neck

3757,,matched dreamed that scatter magically strewn,It was an excitement that matched my own for I had never sailed the South Seas and I had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny magically named islands strewn across one third of a globe
3758,,By reached,By the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine Ellen and I had long reached New Zealand and were already sailing north towards New Caledonia
3759,,caught back,We caught the bus back to Ellen 's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks

3761,,noting strident evaporated in face,I carried her luggage to the yard noting that even Ellen 's strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bags and tropical heat
3762,,crudely,A large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside Wavebreaker but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in Wavebreaker 's white paint
3763,,with sleekly her powerful her her,There was nothing wrong with the boat 's lines which were sleekly functional but her long powerful hull her upperworks and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint
3764,,disguise from prying,The seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue black silver green and white had been designed to disguise a boat 's shape from the prying eyes of U-Boat captains so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the Bahamas
3765,,She boasted fly canopy held,She boasted a harpoon walkway a fly and above the highest wheel-platform an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial
3766,appearance,her had giving padded electric chair gave her bows those use,The fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number 666 that was painted on her bows in silver-edged black numerals like those warships use to display their commissioning numbers
3767,,wrap-around added to ugly air,The boat 's wrap-around windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added to Dream Baby 's ugly air of menace

3770,,back bare,It 's scraped back to bare metal
3771,,give,I 'll give it some paint
3772,,strong weakened,Wavebreaker 's hull was made of steel and while such hulls are marvellously strong and safe they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air
3773,,bite into sleekness,I had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite into Wavebreaker 's long sleekness
3774,,to rule without dug,Ellen ignored my advice while I obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush
3775,,ring bells,Then from behind me an unfamiliar voice sounded Oh ring my bells
3776,,lazy,It was a man 's voice drawling and lazy
3777,,through,I twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun but then through the dizzying glare I made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed incongruously to be dressed in a long transparent dressing gown
3778,,in companion,He was emerging in stately fashion from Wavebreaker 's companion and though I could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair I could make out no details of his face
3779,,hell,Who the hell are you

3784,,To at,To my astonishment and chagrin Ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at her
3785,,stroked with,My name he stroked her with his voice is Jesse Isambard Sweetman

3787,,parchment dark,His long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon his skin was parchment pale and his eyes dark
3788,,put at showed showed liberty,I put his age at forty but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome and he knew it for his expression showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold Ellen 's hand and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away
3789,,dramatic models in with elegant,It was a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind I only expected to see on the male models who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard Wavebreaker yet Jesse Isambard Sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance
3790,,note in bore,The only incongruous note was a cheap round badge enamelled in red and yellow that he wore on his shirt which bore the legend Just Say No
3791,,bestowed on,No he said helpfully then bestowed a patronising smile on me
3792,,brightly dim,Oh indeed I did he said brightly as though he merely indulged a rather dim child 's curiosity

3794,,symptoms small fearful,Precautions are the symptoms of small and fearful minds
3795,,conquer build transmute into carry win dropped,Precautions will not conquer empires they will not build great cities they will not transmute dreams into gold or carry men across wide oceans and precautions will not emphatically not win fair ladies and here he turned to Ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare legs
3796,,at brushed,Ellen twisted away and Sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture then as coolly as though he owned Wavebreaker he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at then sat on one of the white cushioned seats by the ship 's wheel

3798,,this next,He 's not here this afternoon but you can doubtless telephone him next week

3802,,this pale slim,Sweetman paused again this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter
3803,,in high,One week in high season costs ten thousand US dollars for two people and every extra couple is another thousand bucks
3804,,cold,Ellen 's voice was cold as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity
3805,,to those add,And to those prices you have to add the boat 's running costs
3806,,lot,A lot
3807,,drew plume at,Sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette then blew a plume of smoke into Wavebreaker 's rigging before smiling lazily at Ellen
3808,,sweet count toy,And tell me sweet creature do you count as a toy

3815,,threat,The gun 's threat had not stopped my advance
3816,,calling turn into mincemeat,I was calling Sweetman 's bluff confident he would not dare pull the trigger and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat
3817,,filled with offered,I was also half drunk and thus filled with the Dutch courage offered by Mama Sipcott 's worst white wine
3818,,beat that slicing,We beat southwards all that first day slicing through a glittering sea and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind

3820,,retreated fierce,She did not stay there long but retreated from the fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with Ellen
3821,,between painful,The contrast between the two American girls was almost painful Ellen was so healthy and strong while the waif-like Robin-Anne was pathetically wan and listless

3843,,spirits forbidden hamper success,For once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits on Wavebreaker for Jackson Chatterton 's drug clinic had utterly forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme
3844,,dry,We were thus officially a dry boat though I had hidden some Irish whiskey in the engine room and I was sure that Ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka

3846,,produced generous slug,He chuckled produced two cardboard cups and poured me a generous slug of the whiskey

3854,,had planned thrash open had,I had nothing particular planned merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean though mindful of the danger of tropical storms I had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a Bahamian hurricane hole
3855,,long hard reckoned out shake down,But I fancied feeling the long hard pressure of ocean waves against our hull and though we were short-handed I reckoned that a few days out sight of land would shake us all down quickly

3865,,from that,The big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twins and for that I was grateful

3909,,at,I like the sounds of a boat sailing at night
3910,,those magnifies sharpens yielding sigh hiss sliding sleek curl sheared into slices,The sounds are the same as those of daylight yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block the sigh of air over a shroud the stretching of a sail the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull the curl of a quarter-wave falling away and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness
3911,,at slits path,I like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits a path across an empty planet
3912,like,secretiveness prospect betrayal at feel close to around,I like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn which seems like a betrayal because at night in a boat under sail it is easy to feel very close to God for eternity is all around

4084,,between those to,It would be owners and occupants of Wyvis Hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview and those were Great-Uncle Hilbert who was dead himself and Ivan Langan to whom he had sold the house
4085,,there,As for other occupants how would they know who else had lived there
4086,as,saw omen shadow cast,The encounter he now saw as an omen a shadow cast by a coming event
4087,,that,What would that event be
4088,,at this point made feel sick,Adam did not want at this point to speculate it made hi– feel sick
4089,,that those,He turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs
4090,,In high spirits about immense advances made in in,In high spirits his father was talking about the immense advances made in forensic science in recent years
4091,,in,Their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom Adam looked Rufus Fletcher up in the phone book
4092,,in there at at,He was in there twice at a Wimpole Street number and again at an address in Mill Hill Rufus H. Fletcher MB MRCP
4093,,these,All these years then or for some of them Rufus had been living three or four miles from him
4094,,change point in pursuing that,Women marry and change their names he thought there was no point in pursuing that one
4095,,where that get,Of course he could look up Robin Tatian but where really would that get him
4096,,back,He was reaching-for the blue directory when Anne came back with Abigail in her arms so Adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her
4097,,had worry about coming to way worried,He wondered if Rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way Adam worried
4098,,whole,Was his whole life affected by what had happened at Ecalpemos
4099,,escaped suppressed jerked away from those,Adam might have escaped the file memories for years suppressed them and jerked violently away from them but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events
4100,,felt way,Sometimes he felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way he did because of their effects
4101,,gone to with,Everything that was left everything he and Rufus had n't sold had gone to Ivan Langan with the house
4102,,song bear,For a song too because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back meeting a valuer walking about the house picking things off shelves and out of cupboards
4103,,taken put down top,He asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house
4104,,in that,It was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done nothing had been touched
4105,,till,From the pine wood he simply averted his eyes till later
4106,,caught,The drift was thickly overgrown a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught at his clothes
4107,,these whipped back drove pad,One of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger
4108,,That,That thorn had been there festering for months
4109,,dull from before,A dull cool summer it had been as different as could be from the year before
4110,,golden bathed,No golden light bathed the red brick of the house
4111,,severe to reproachful,Beautiful yes but severe somehow and to Adam 's heightened awareness reproachful
4112,,found encouraging fostering scenario,He found himself encouraging fostering the scenario illusion
4113,,this part shaggy,Only thus only by pretending unreality pretending this was a part he acted could he go on cross the wild shaggy grass go past the black-branched cedar tree arrive at the porch set in its four Doric columns and insert his key in the lock
4114,,reduced to acquire in formal training course,Task analysis has not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course
4115,,in creative,The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do
4116,,in rigid to flexibility,The danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance
4117,,flexible have from design training courses,The danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces training courses and other operator aids
4118,,to,If a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being
4119,,performance,Yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable
4120,,arrived at in context,There is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system
4121,,mentioned twin get present,As mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it
4122,,proceed on this this have,It is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of If I were doing the job this is how I would do it but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators
4123,,creating arrived at this against gain,For analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience
4124,,about synthesis way,A particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness
4125,,part design origins made,A task description which is part of a design process should be fully documented in terms of the origins of information the assumptions made and the methods used
4126,,producing at levels assemble in network,The standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network
4127,,these separate into small units with,There is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large but often it is more useful to separate into small units with cross-referencing
4128,,this circulated contain,The optimum size seems to be A3 this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail
4129,,production manipulation storage block with facilities,The procedure can be computerised there are programmes available for the easy production manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities
4130,,in from from,There is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it
4131,,Those find gain from,Those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description
4132,,in in looking at include in in conducts,Task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower but in looking at cost/value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts the analysis
4133,,long,If such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the Delphi method rather than a long series of group meetings
4134,,arise in conducting discussed in context,Political economic and social issues which arise in conducting Task Analyses are discussed in the context of Job Analysis p. 148
4135,,Application,Application
4136,,Resource central generating asset made progress over,The Human Resource concept of man-power as the central generating asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years
4137,,around stable,There was particular interest around 1970 when companies were prosperous stable and innovative IPM 1972 Patten 1971
4138,,reverse resource consuming in form,The objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments overheads in the form of heated lighted equipped workspaces and so on
4139,,From narrow viewpoint desirable keep this low,From the narrow accountancy viewpoint people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible
4140,,In these member on training course,In these terms it is very difficult to justify for example sending a member of staff on a training course
4141,,training,The training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away
4142,,Where return,Where is the return
4143,,return in resource this in,The return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use
4144,,reduce resources to this form measurement,There have been two attempts to reduce human resources to this form of measurement Giles and Robinson 1972
4145,,acquire asset level,One is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff
4146,,with level,The multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management
4147,,together from through to,The other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments
4148,,attempt obtain,The first does attempt to obtain a value the second remains essentially a cost and not a value
4149,,assume risen to level undertaken assumed to,It would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level such that costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value
4150,,direct measure to senior fall rise leaves joins,A less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company
4151,,This high large in market,This can be very high for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual
4152,,serious view high level give this weight,The most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight
4153,,have resources scanty about asset,For example the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset
4154,,described,Indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known
4155,,broad state negative features strikes low,Similarly broad factors such as the state of morale will again only be described by negative features such as absenteeism stoppages strikes low quality output and so on
4156,,reflect performance level this in brief within,It is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the man-power and its performance level but if this is acknowledged at all it is only in brief verbal terms within for example the chairman 's annual report
4157,,with reduction to manipulation situation,The obsession of current management with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation
4158,,remedy,Unfortunately there is no easy remedy
4159,,resources susceptible to beyond level,Human resources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades
4160,,at level expressible,Key variables such as the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive terms
4161,,depress in in high levels these,It is generally accepted p. 145 that hygiene type variables such as pay and working conditions can if they are inappropriately specified depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters
4162,,in attitudes,Morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management
4163,,These emphasis in dealt with in takes make,These factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference
4164,,senior take keep about,for example very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes
4165,,on continuous in,The result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms
4166,,measured,The two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex
4167,,distribution source,The age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information
4168,,rectangular distribution mix ageing,For most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience
4169,,makes retire replaced,It also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced
4170,,distributions show peak in group with large this desirable leads to at stages,Many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages
4171,,These where this large,These comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move out this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in European countries and in Japan but much less so in the U.S.A.
4172,,Stable have familiarity with in market,Stable work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable
4173,,This in high plant where extensive,This is particularly so in high technology e.g. design and construction of ships aircraft power stations and chemical plant where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive
4174,,peaks dealt with using fit with,Some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation
4175,,In length level in this with,In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements
4176,,train keep nucleus in that,Given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise
4177,,On hand keep have with little between,On the other hand if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects
4178,,have shifting between,It is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties
4179,,This flexibility in,This not only provides flexibility in the use of man-power it also improves communication
4180,,These force larger larger,These real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic
4181,,Size cushion to markets,Size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems
4182,,feeling within to,For example difficulties of communications and in particular how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation
4183,,This in in,This is considered in more detail in Chapter 3
4184,,resources to subjects centred at level from through down to,Human resources should be fundamental to subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through countries regions and companies down to particular working systems
4185,,This makers take account,This is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions
4186,,design,The design of procedures
4187,,support led to design within,The increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system Fig. 1.30
4188,,this in extensive,Much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator
4189,,This takes forms,This takes three main forms checklists routines and knowledge-texts
4190,,in this field,The terminology in this field is not standardised
4191,,restricted in this to include sources,Software might be restricted as in this book to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information
4192,,here support,Procedures is sometimes used for what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator 's information support except software
4193,,situation further confused support based,The situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself based
4194,,design,However whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort
4195,,followed simple,The quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guide-lines Table 1.16
4196,,on,Many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking
4197,,assumed under take place those,Similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office
4198,,plant under,They may have to be read in the open air in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily cramped poorly lit conditions
4199,,has under stress,The user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions
4200,,structure reflect,The material on which the information is printed the typeface used the sequence the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use Easterby and Zwaga 1984
4201,,these things under,All these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use
4202,,in,Checklists are used in the pre-start mode for routine maintenance and for fault-finding
4203,,take form guide,They normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components
4204,,dictated in taken in,The sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which actions should be taken for example in starting up an aircraft
4205,,situations great in this structure,There are many situations when the order is of no great consequence for example a safety audit of a new machine and in this latter case some logical structure is needed
4206,,mentioned above design way,As mentioned above the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different
4207,,emerge in situation,Baker 1984 suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation
4208,,from,The operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks
4209,,reveals in design access,Systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access visibility and labelling
4210,,have vertical horizontal structure poor linking points,Finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical or horizontal structure poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements descriptions remarks and tick-off points
4211,,reproduced in,The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in Edholm 1967
4212,,about extensive content,There is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content
4213,,context context conceived,The context is of course the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list
4214,,form material,A routine is the most common form of instructional material
4215,,follow steps introduce in performance,The reader is required to follow a series of steps which might for example introduce a change in the performance of a complex system
4216,,chains have branching,Normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching
4217,,step simple in with in flow,Each step should be simple and complete in itself preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material
4218,,regarded,As mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description
4219,,design inflexible,By definition and design intention routines are inflexible
4220,,great way saying under-used avoid step reversing steps,No great skill or intellectual effort is required which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a step or reversing steps
4221,,formal left to in,In general the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator left to himself will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner
4222,,contained in from to large,Knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals
4223,,material indirect told in,As instructional material it is indirect in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do as in a routine
4224,,about situation base from,Rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions
4225,,follow,It is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake
4226,,applied with material,The need to know criterion is crucial because unless it is applied the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material
4227,,material,Correspondingly the material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used
4228,,In this context guide,In this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book
4229,,material in short in flowing,It is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically systematically or at least in well-structured short paragraphs rather than in flowing prose
4230,,Consider about from centre,Consider for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets
4231,,Note enormous flexibility with tell point,Note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another
4232,,in lost in make correction,A second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary
4233,,in making about proceed in filtering out from massive,However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance for a particular task which is equally available
4234,,with,Thus one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable
4235,,With avoid substructure in form features,With two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers
4236,,contain materials warrant,Manuals which may contain maps schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration
4237,,design,The design of manuals
4238,,in form,A manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer
4239,,form with on,Thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance
4240,,standard design low,The standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several reasons
4241,,this with takes,For this purpose the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know
4242,,at end running out regarded design,Often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed
4243,,poor,Manuals for cars machine tools and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions
4244,,about in these accessible to,Most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation
4245,,on in stages with,The computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual at least in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions
4246,,served design,He is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known
4247,,divided into parts in,For most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in Table 1.17
4248,,part introduction towards structure limits,The first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system its purpose its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits
4249,,This followed section on set up in place working,This should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly
4250,,into power,If it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it fix it into position connect it to power supplies and start it up
4251,,emphasis on,If it is large the emphasis will be on the start up procedure
4252,,section describing cover,The section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it
4253,,Extensive desirable where this into short with into,Extensive use of line drawings schematic diagrams algorithmic lists is desirable and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs
4254,,section symptoms,The maintenance section should indicate what if anything the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required
4255,,into Remedies,Tables subdivided into Remedies can be extremely helpful
4256,,including deal with,Parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements
4257,,assume with,A standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses
4258,,to to forced consider,A glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms
4259,,with contents at,Finally all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning
4260,,Framework,The School Framework
4261,,Model Link to,A Model to Link Personality Characteristics to a Preference for Science
4262,,Introduction,Introduction
4263,,In steady play role in subject,In recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success
4264,,this collection separate pieces synthesizing power,Unfortunately this evidence has tended to be fragmentary a collection of separate discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power
4265,,models to far go,The few models which have been developed to date may have been correct as far as they go but are clearly incomplete
4266,,lonely isolation through strong in world below interest in,For example Roe 1952 Eiduson 1962 and McClelland 1962 suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships
4267,,saw undemanding appealing to moving from to turbulence,Maslow 1966 and Hudson 1966 and 1968 saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence
4268,,these leave open questions mechanisms operate with,Even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls
4269,,Arising from in from model with has,Arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential
4270,,about,What we know about persons choosing science
4271,,association between interest in,The evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by Head 1979
4272,,take note features,We need now only take note of the most salient features
4273,,that,The most obvious one is that of sex differences
4274,,in throughout to small to,The predominance of males particularly in the physical sciences and engineering throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences which are too small nor to institutional factors
4275,,in made with,Equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women
4276,,those show clear,Furthermore the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences
4277,,mature in upon in take,Male scientists both science students and mature professional scientists tend to be emotionally reticent disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives
4278,,in,They will also tend to be authoritarian conservative and controlled in their thinking
4279,,These seen on found,These differences can be seen quite early on we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers
4280,,rigid in have low,Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive
4281,,at about high proportion attracted to,We also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers
4282,,steady interest in this extends through into,Thereafter there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period
4283,,In contrast express interest in at swing from in middle,In contrast only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens
4284,,come from with pupils part,Some further evidence has come from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at Chelsea
4285,,these responses on between those subjects,Analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects
4286,,at take mature attitude to seeing nature,For example girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature while boys are more exploitative
4287,,stem produce responses go through patch with,In relation to the sentence stem A girl and her mother girls often produce responses like often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other become the best of friends or can help each other with their problems
4288,,produce seen source,Similar questions when asked of boys tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones for example the parent is seen as the source of money
4289,,In contrast have firmer clearer showing stems felt,In contrast boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as My main problem is and He/she felt proud that
4290,,give about these,Such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages
4291,,with find have views on,If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues
4292,,take view,For example they take the view that criminals should be severely punished or that anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate
4293,,To stem join in these gave,To the sentence stem When a child will not join in group activities these boys gave responses like he is selfish he must be stupid he deserves to be unpopular
4294,,In contrast ways into,In contrast other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group
4295,,possess,The science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties they offered clear-cut answers
4296,,this suggested model subject,It was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement
4297,,in,Ego-identity in adolescence
4298,,This model,This model was originally postulated by Erikson 1965 and then developed by Marcia 1966 and 1976
4299,,suggests at phases faces before moving on to next phase,Erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase
4300,,acquisition clear,For adolescents the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task
4301,,At within,At the beginning of adolescence the individual is a within the family and the school
4302,,By end make about,By the end of adolescence he or she needs to make choices about career life-style personal relationships and ideologies
4303,,that shaped these,The ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choices
4304,,about arise with in context in on,Some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school and others occur in later life for example on retirement
4305,,dominates,Nevertheless adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while
4306,,clear on at,The adolescent does not however need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time
4307,,have clear in to,He or she may have a clear identity in respect to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology
4308,,In this with in to,In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career
4309,,put detail onto model in going from diffusion condition to that crisis,Marcia has put more detail onto the Erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity two processes are involved crisis and commitment
4310,,Crisis in this context describes self-examination in values,Crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one 's beliefs and values are re-examined
4311,,means has acquired clear firm about,Commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself or herself and the world
4312,,indicates routes to,Figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements
4313,,crisis progress route self-examination in fluid before acquiring route,A person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one 's beliefs tend to be very fluid a period known as moratorium before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved route B
4314,,hold onto values taken without from,A further possibility is that the individual may at least for a time hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others for example parents teachers peers
4315,,This condition foreclosure,This condition is known as foreclosure
4316,,these crisis self-examination route foreclosure offer escape route self-examination clinging rigidly to values route,Eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis of self-examination and so achieve ego-identity by route C. However foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his or her beliefs and values route D
4317,,make link between this model subject in,We can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools
4318,,at foreclosure stage,For boys at the foreclosure stage science is likely to be appealing
4319,,offer win from,The physical sciences in particular offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents teachers and peers
4320,,regard in soft,They will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions including much such expression in the arts as being soft and feminine
4321,,with image makes demand on offer clear answers to,Science with its masculine image makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear precise answers to problems
4322,,permit reinforce,Opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence
4323,,at foreclosure stage situation,For a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different
4324,,into roles through through,There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career Douvan and Adelson 1966
4325,,these go into with image attracts,Furthermore these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image one which already attracts many girls
4326,,at foreclosure stage enter model from,Consequently very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school
4327,,at stage attracted to presented in,Neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools
4328,,at stage with seen with contribute to these,They are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues the meaning of life the existence of God ideologies their emerging sexuality their future career and life-style too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates
4329,,to in,Science somehow seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life
4330,,proportion at stage choose,A proportion of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science
4331,,In entering at this stage self-examination make this,In fact most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice
4332,,reached stage at pupils make about subject at,However only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school
4333,,This model explain observations,This model seems to explain our observations
4334,,large at foreclosure stage attracted to drift away throughout crisis,A large number of boys particularly at the foreclosure stage are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis
4335,,at foreclosure stage yield rigid attitudes with,The preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists
4336,,enter these foreclosure,The few girls who enter science will not usually show these foreclosure characteristics
4337,,Changes,Effects of Curriculum Changes
4338,,this model linking to subject allows make about pupils react to changes in,The real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization
4339,,consider changes,We can consider three possible changes
4340,,subject in pupils make about subject in range,Delaying subject choice Britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13–16 age range
4341,,These reversed with great,These decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty
4342,,make,What effect would delaying the choice make
4343,,In through foreclosure pupils into cut,In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut
4344,,reached stage proportion these go into,More boys and girls will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science
4345,,reduction in those stay in subject flexible,Overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possess more flexible minds
4346,,met,The quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement
4347,,Giving image in showing,Giving science a more feminine image It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys rather than girls doing practical work in the laboratory and so forth
4348,,change this image have,What effect would a deliberate attempt to change this image have
4349,,make at foreclosure stage,It might make it easier for girls at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase
4350,,these drift away reach crisis,Some of these girls might however drift away again when they reach their crisis period
4351,,change in image,Unless the change in image was immense boys would probably not be affected science would still be an obvious acceptable choice for a boy
4352,,in,Overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls but no qualitative improvement
4353,,Emphasizing applications to in with with possessing flexible make to at stage,Emphasizing the applications and relevance of science To obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage
4354,,In that seen to,In that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them
4355,,presented in context,The probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals
4356,,approach application interaction with,Probably a case-study approach involving the application of science and the interaction with other disciplines would be needed
4357,,about with suggests elements into attractive,Our knowledge about the girls ' concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive
4358,,change in this fashion preserve character,Is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself
4359,,pruning,Clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content
4360,,cover subjects,Perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively
4361,,cover over,A history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decades
4362,,make,Perhaps we must make similar choices
4363,,on coming from advocating changes,It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education 1979 policy statement in Britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the Institute for Science Education IPN in Kiel are advocating such changes
4364,,formal model reduce encapsulation recruit changes,The difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science if we want to recruit a different sort of student then certain curriculum changes are needed
4365,,take take,Approximately three times as many boys as girls take O level physics and approximately four times as many take CSE physics
4366,,Over entries in subjects from,Over 90 per cent of entries in all technical subjects are from boys
4367,,This means wide range courses in higher entry to occupations base,This means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide range of courses in further and higher education and for entry to occupations requiring a scientific or technical base
4368,,from means control,Female exclusion from science and technology even if it is apparently by girls ' own choice also means that as citizens their ability to understand and control their environment is limited
4369,,consider neutral,Nevertheless most schools consider they are already providing equal opportunities by neutral treatment of the two sexes Bloomfield 1984
4370,,In in this way reinforces does challenge aspects,In effect ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine
4371,,addressing in took in investigated,Girls Into Science and Technology GIST was the first major schools-based project addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school and was an example of action research in education the project simultaneously took action to improve girls ' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reasons for their under-achievement
4372,,collaborated with in designed attitudes to subjects,The project team collaborated with teachers in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the Greater Manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed to improve girls ' attitudes to the physical sciences and technical subjects
4373,,controls attitude took place,Two other schools were involved as controls where attitude testing but no interventions took place
4374,,approach with in find to,The approach was collaborative teachers were invited to work with the team as equal partners in the attempts both to investigate and find solutions to the GIST problem
4375,,recognized at start spent in towards,However very few of the teachers even recognized the issue as one of professional concern at the start of the project and most of the first two years was spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategies
4376,,elsewhere,The project and its outcomes have been fully described elsewhere Smail et al
4377,,in,1982 Kelly Whyte and Smail 1984 Whyte in press
4378,,had in attitudes subject change attitudes,GIST had more success in altering children 's attitudes than their subject choices suggesting that it is easier to change attitudes and beliefs than actual behaviour
4379,,Pupils in pupils control,Pupils in action schools became markedly less stereotyped than pupils in control schools
4380,,had attitudes towards define,They also had slightly more positive attitudes towards science and scientists and were less likely to define them as exclusively masculine
4381,,change in attitudes admit,Despite some evidence of change in teachers ' attitudes and behaviour they themselves were reluctant to admit that the project had influenced them
4382,,this reflect admit in,According to an evaluation report this may reflect an unwillingness to admit that in the past schools have been sex biased Payne Cuff and Hustler 1984
4383,,in constructed based on see,The GIST hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed by the school an hypothesis based on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis see for example Kelly 1981
4384,,shift away from locating towards change nature,During the project there was a shift away from locating the issue as one of girls ' motivation towards attempts to change the nature of school science
4385,,from meant appeal to interests,One of the main gains from the GIST project has been the clarification of what is meant by a girl friendly science that is a science which will appeal equally to the interests and concerns of girls as well as boys
4386,,Making,Making Science More Girl Friendly
4387,,designed make,Several interventions were designed to make science more girl friendly
4388,,tried build on interests changing patterns,Schools and teachers tried curriculum development to build on girls ' science interests changing patterns of classroom interaction single sex groups and classes
4389,,largest scale to about aspect covered in,The largest scale intervention was the VISTA programme which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect of their jobs already being covered in the school science syllabus
4390,,made in ways attractive image concentrated on applications element from at,VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science an element too often missing from science at school
4391,,reactions in include applications,One school was so impressed by the children 's positive reactions that they completely revamped the science work in the first two years to include more social and human applications of science
4392,,survey attitudes helped here shown in approach in,The survey of children 's attitudes helped here research such as Ormerod 's 1971 Ormerod and Duckworth 1975 had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice
4393,,in home starter,Would science in the home be a starter
4394,,from survey asked about,A question from our survey asked children whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner works hardly anyone did and girls were even less curious than boys
4395,,This told about interests in meet with,This told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring female domestic interests in science would probably meet with failure
4396,,about showed about keen about,The rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science and that girls were keen to know more about nature the environment and medical science
4397,,Over in over about work makes,Over 50 per cent and in some cases over 60 per cent said they would like to learn about the human heart germs and illnesses how our muscles work what food is good for you life in the sea what makes a rainbow appear and how a record is made
4398,,these,It was helpful that these topics also interested boys
4399,,structured around interests on keener work build on overlapping interests about features,At present the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests on which boys are keener how motor cars work atoms and molecules we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes because girls as well as boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment animals in the jungle volcanoes and earthquakes acids and chemicals
4400,,attractive parts approached through these interests with action via,The less immediately attractive parts of science could be approached through these interests for instance teaching forces by beginning with the action of muscles in the human arm and light via the dissection of a bull 's eye
4401,,approaches double,When women scientists employ such approaches and describe their own work as happened during the VISTA programme girls are receiving double encouragement
4402,,These indicate features builds on interests encourages see includes applications,These examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science it builds on girls ' interests not just boys ' it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science
4403,,on ran to,All the GIST schools were mixed comprehensives and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all on the grounds that it ran counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy
4404,,struck large in interests brought with,Then certain teachers were particularly struck by the evidence of large differences in the interests and experience children brought with them to school
4405,,had far connection with interest in,Girls had far less tinkering experience than boys and the connection with their lesser interest in topics like how electricity is produced seemed obvious
4406,,in planned,Several special science or craft clubs were organized in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned single-sex teaching
4407,,see in these largest changes attitude,As we shall see it was in these two schools that the largest measurable changes of attitude and option choice occurred
4408,,vital come see packaging in resources removed about,For a more girl friendly science it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging evident in textbooks and resources as well as teachers ' and boys ' behaviour in the classroom is removed girls can be very enthusiastic about science
4409,,sees distinct in,Alison Kelly sees at least four distinct senses in which it can be argued that science is masculine
4410,,pupils packaged presented appeal to operate reconstruct world view,First the pupils teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers second school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys not girls third classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity and finally it has been suggested that scientific thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view
4411,,above these balance followed repackaging remove appeal showed comes defined in,The GIST interventions described above relate to three of these VISTA women albeit briefly and temporarily redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists VISTA and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited repackaging of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as masculine in the mixed school
4412,,point sustained clinging to narrow,The fourth point the idea that science is intrinsically masculine can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking
4413,,impact on on on focus on from,The industrial and social impact of science on health on people on the environment a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world are notable omissions from the school science syllabus
4414,,in version meet in,Girls are not uninterested in science they are bored by the limited version of it they meet in school
4415,,extended see approach discover,One of the purposes of an extended period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see how girls approach scientific matters and to discover what may well be the case that girls are just as capable of scientific thinking as boys
4416,,in from in this found higher,Margaret Spear in a different study from the one reported in this volume found that for identical work boys were marked higher than girls for supposed understanding of principles aptitude for science and O level suitability Spear 1984
4417,,under,Attempting to integrate under fives
4418,,within,During the 1980s Margaret Boushel Claire Debenham Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach worked in the London borough of Islington within social services for pre-school children

4439,,In these from,In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2
4440,,these wide range backgrounds this reflected in background,The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers
4441,,By designed with in in in,By 1983 residential services were designed with care in the community in mind but most were based in specialist settings
4442,,with designed,For example Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties and was designed to offer respite round the clock care
4443,,fought this resource,Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home
4444,,By,By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children 's respite care unit at Leigh Road
4445,,in by reduced to with with,The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties
4446,,had,The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision
4447,,in network,They were joined in the network by specialist teachers funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools who visited children at home before they were due to start school
4448,,This on coordinate,This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues
4449,,took place,Discussion of services to individual children also took place
4450,,This between attitudes to,This included deciding between day care or school and parents ' attitudes to different options
4451,,member on course,Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action
4452,,aim from to fullest,The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age to enable them to develop to their fullest potential
4453,,operating without to in,They were however an all-White group operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community
4454,,gave support to saw these,They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to treat children
4455,,contact had in steering towards,Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision
4456,,In,In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for partially hearing children
4457,,These in,These social workers were based in the borough 's Special Services Team
4458,,under covered,They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered
4459,,have access to resources support,They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability
4460,,arose within this in in under with,When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs
4461,,This had drawing into system at stage,This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage
4462,,step in about,Instead for a number of reasons it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington
4463,,attached to,First the post was not attached to any specialist institution
4464,,closely,There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery
4465,,had under in controlling access to under-,Second the worker had an alternative peer group of under workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under- facilities
4466,,to take over,Third the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child 's social emotional and cultural needs
4467,,in network made broader to,There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents
4468,,in had aim to,The Labour Council elected in 1982 had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort
4469,,This led to under-,This led to the initiation of an under- review
4470,,set up under under in,The review team set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee included councillors senior departmental management and representatives of the children 's day centre organisers and under social workers in its membership
4471,,network under- under-,It proposed a network of under- centres throughout the borough an idea which the under- workers had been anxious to promote for some time
4472,,coordinated through support resources to,Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children 's day centres which would also provide information support and resources to parents
4473,,made with,The review had made no mention of children with special needs
4474,,under- with in resources these,The specialist social worker and another under- worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children
4475,,designed in,They interviewed parents specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations as well as by some child-minders
4476,,confirmed with given fight hard this,Broadly the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice
4477,,part feel,Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were
4478,,on about range on,Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer
4479,,felt given to,One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good
4480,,fought hard get in,She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended
4481,,have go went ahead,Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to have a go and the placement went ahead
4482,,fight step way this,I had to fight every step of the way for this
4483,,about have,No one told me about it and no one wanted him to have it
4484,,this,I knew it was right for him this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children
4485,,in flexible way,Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist therapy time but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way
4486,,worried lead to with,Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs
4487,,widely in with with,Definitions of special needs varied widely in the questionnaire responses some defining it as children with disabilities some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English
4488,,This made,This made the survey difficult to interpret
4489,,in in with with these,The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children CCUF 1983 and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs with suggestions for how these might be overcome
4490,,These informed produced member generate within through,These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee
4491,,this Under to under look at within,As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives CCUF an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision
4492,,produce to,Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate
4493,,These under-,These included parents under- workers specialist workers children 's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers
4494,,these came up with,Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending
4495,,About held in,About 230 people attended the conference held in April 1985
4496,,in sources,Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information
4497,,made,The conference made the following recommendations
4498,,system covering resources,For a formal universal information system covering local and specialist resources
4499,,considered,For children 's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised
4500,,with,For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs
4501,,with access to,For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision
4502,,in,For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision specialist provision and child-minders
4503,,greater resources between,For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision
4504,,reflect backgrounds those with environment express consciousness,For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children and that for all children including those with special needs their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington
4505,,made clear above areas,It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health education and social services before they could be implemented
4506,,felt attitudes towards,Finally it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration none of the recommendations could be effective
4507,,Over against where ruled in machines offered,Over against the German army or the Vichy government where social generality ruled as it does in all machines of state the Resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal
4508,,elements appear here inclined to seen in,The psychological and moral elements of political action were almost the only ones to appear here which is why intellectuals least inclined to politics were to be seen in the Resistance
4509,,preserve in this broke away from confronts in face,The Resistance was a unique experience for them and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new French politics because this experience broke away from the famous dilemma of being and doing which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action
4510,,this balance between intimately bound up with survive,It is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it
4511,,in this sense said making relationship between between fostered masked power taught in connection,And in this sense it must be said that the Resistance experience by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the Occupation taught us in another connection
4512,,by here indicated in followed unite with that relocate within reconcile with with that with,If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre 's project in the Critique the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of Sartre 's earlier work that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one 's own freedom how to relocate human practice within historical determinism to reconcile the individual with the social the idea of agency with that of necessity or freedom with history
4513,,through,For Marxist or Hegelian thought such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operations of dialectical logic
4514,,in make under given transmitted from this,Citing Marx 's famous remark in The Eighteenth Brumaire Men make their own History but under circumstances given and transmitted from the past Sartre suggested that this implied the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity I 35
4515,,shift away from towards with end include articulate with with,Accordingly he attempted to shift Marxism away from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of History which while still a totality as it had been for Lukács a process with a determinate meaning and end could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social freedom with determinism
4516,,to extent returning to retrieve subject goes together with get out of systems,Today Sartre 's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject which goes together with the wish to get out of the apparently totalizing systems of Adorno Althusser or Foucault
4517,,stress on role subject finds those prepared progress narrative struggle return subject next thing in,Sartre 's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of struggle have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative the subject almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself
4518,,leaves with link with agent,But it still leaves us with the crucial problem that Sartre had to solve namely how to link human consciousness with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the agent of the latter
4519,,this take,How could this take place
4520,,put in,As Sartre had put it in What is Literature
4521,,made felt before,Never has homo faber better understood that he has made history and never has he felt so powerless before history
4522,,make at makes,How can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him
4523,,considered takes way out eliminating making passive product,Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances
4524,,follow dropping through movement that produce material,Unwilling to follow Merleau-Ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement of praxis that is intentional actions which produce material effects
4525,,inert,Its corollary whereby praxis becomes determining history he called the inert by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis
4526,,deftly uniting with,The individual is thus both totalizer and totalized deftly uniting freedom with necessity
4527,,this neatly solves make at makes answer larger products into blind movements say,Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts totalizations can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality rather than being the arbitrary blind and self-cancelling movements of say Hardy 's immanent will
4528,,in answer separate antagonistic yield lead to progress direction,Sartre 's fundamental thesis that History continually effects totalisations of totalisations I 15 does not in itself answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as the question for Sartre how do separate antagonistic actions yield a history how do individual totalizations lead to Totalization and also progress the direction of history its truth and its meaning
4529,,whole law powerful force revealing behind continuously produced in turn part in broader,For the whole basis of Sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind History like the will of God but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader developing totalization I 37
4530,,law works from level produces,What Sartre needs to demonstrate therefore is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such
4531,,law impose on at woven out of,The dialectic is the law of totalization which creates several collectivities several societies and one history realities that is which impose themselves on individuals but at the same time it must be woven out of millions of individual actions
4532,,show force,We must show that it is possible for it to be both a resultant and a totalizing force how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration
4533,,produces direction,But what produces the overall direction of History
4534,,this shifting to,Sartre does not attempt to answer this question shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness
4535,,law hidden,The dialectic is the law that remains hidden
4536,,At made without political unconscious,At the moment history is made without being known l'histoire se fait sans se connâitre history constitutes we might say today a political unconscious
4537,,on hand conscious conscious subject understand recognize,Marxism on the other hand Sartre claims is History itself becoming conscious of itself I 40 as for Lukács it is by becoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history 's meaning and so recognize itself as the meaning of history
4538,,suggests in tones in this take forms struggle admits divorce between under clear among masses,While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place and that civil foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses
4539,,detour descent into unconscious in dream-work eluded into reading,The detour of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism 's own descent into its unconscious resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism 's own reading of history
4540,,make recognition seen combine make with,It is therefore Sartre argues our historical task to make it known promoting not just the historical process as such but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history with one meaning the Truth of humanity I 822
4541,,account sets up articulation elements save from detour from,Sartre 's account thus sets up the articulation of history univocal meaning and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of Marxism necessary in order to save it from its detour from itself
4542,,remains produced from initiating,The problem however remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes
4543,,internally without inner moving,If History is a history of conflict how could it be both one and internally diversified without the inner moving principle of the dialectic
4544,,aimed at destroying in double negation in aims destroyed,How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original aims of each action have been destroyed by the other
4545,,aim in,If each action negates the aim of the other where is the unity totalized in the conflict
4546,,arrives at that without at end until next show make up with,I 817 18 Sartre arrives at what he calls the real problem of History that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer only at the very end of Volume I. It is not until the next volume however that he intends to show how individual actions separate multiplicities make up one human history with one truth and one intelligibility I 69
4547,,Throughout taken,Throughout Sartre has nevertheless taken it for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as History and as historical Truth I 822
4548,,in assumed,His History therefore is always in process but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed
4549,,projecting forwards,He thus asserts the Truth of History while constantly projecting forwards and deferring its proof
4550,,comes turns out rest on true,But when the proof comes it also turns out to rest on the assumption that it is already true
4551,,produces persuasive formulation relation to through inert to larger,Sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the inert it is also obvious to him how the larger question of History ought to be solved
4552,,in seen demonstration,But in Volume I of the Critique as we have seen he continually defers the demonstration of his proof
4553,,whole naturally operative movement produces goes beyond,For the dogmatic dialectic as he describes dialectical materialism the whole question naturally poses no problem for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produces them and then goes beyond them
4554,,dispensing with schemas between,But Sartre 's dispensing with all historicist schemas creates the problem of how between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations there could be one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process II 13
4555,,this through matching account with derived from negation,He attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour anti-labour anti-travail a category of negation
4556,,products residues from combatants,The products of a conflict as well as its residues may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants
4557,,encounters products,Dialectical reason encounters such products as undecidables
4558,,at bearing witness to this side in aims destroy,aporias because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing witness to the fact that this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side of two opposed actions in which each aims to destroy the other
4559,,In perspective encounter these objects with in,In the dialectical perspective we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process
4560,,This means lead to internal structure objects contains negation part,This means that first they lead to results and second that the internal structure of social objects contains the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other II 22
4561,,before agents movements in ensembles from afar appear whole close to seen riddled with holes,There is therefore before any understanding of historic agents and movements a certain aporia in all social ensembles from afar they may appear whole but close to they can be seen as riddled with holes
4562,,This comes account,This increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as Sartre 's own account of History
4563,,In context this formulation without force structure negation means,In the context of the negativity of this formulation Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that as for Adorno or Bakhtin history does not develop positively but rather negatively and is therefore instead detotalizing
4564,,true decomposes into in within relationship struggle negation adversary on,Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories or if in any case within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle detotalizing
4565,,have design showing here full,Certainly we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism
4566,,goal in ensemble torn apart reduced to breaks carried along movement ensemble,Our goal is solely to establish whether in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble
4567,,At this point confronts whole on negation negation affirmation break down,At this point Sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the Critique stated so confidently on its very first page it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation I 15 may break down
4568,,direction discerned,perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved its direction can not be discerned
4569,,reaction to threat negation negation produce introduce force incarnates operates,Sartre 's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category a unifying force of a singularization which incarnates the universal If totalization really is an ongoing process he writes then it operates everywhere
4570,,That ensemble in ensemble in richness,That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of its singularity II 26
4571,,from drawn out through works in with relation between structured familiar model organic growth in makes up puts in part present,Unlike Lukács ' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative Sartre 's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while as he puts it the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny
4572,,begs on,Sartre 's singular universal therefore begs the question for it is predicated on the assumption that if there is not a totality as such then there already is an overall totalization If totalization really is an ongoing process
4573,,That through assertion struggles incarnate,That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre 's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal
4574,,in avoid,The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby Sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing
4575,,presumes,So the singular universal presumes the totalization he ca n't yet prove
4576,,This strategy marks structure in without retreats to in end brings back to,This strategy marks a structure of repetition in Sartre 's text each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again
4577,,In this demonstrates works appealing to concrete reproduce adversaries,In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic
4578,,takes through incarnation part in framework within,Its totalization takes place through its incarnation as part of the totality of boxing in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs
4579,,in sense incarnation rules follows sets against,Each boxing match Sartre claims must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing whose rules and conventions it follows and whose past and future history it sets itself against
4580,,that shape,But it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known nor is its future shape even presumed
4581,,here end closure mediation among parts where,By totalization therefore Sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the parts where each is determined by the other
4582,,at level victories defeats in structure at level,No one can predict the future of boxing either at the level of particular victories or defeats in effect a structure of repetition nor at the more general level of possible modifications or developments of the sport
4583,,articulates within framework,Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing known and unknown
4584,,This allows include in,This allows Sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme
4585,,realize in produces in incarnation at to pure that,Since it can not be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment The incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes II 58
4586,,through,The universal the totality can only be known through the singular
4587,,direction,But its future direction remains unknown and indeterminate
4588,,At makes larger works considers,At the same time Sartre makes a larger though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general
4589,,incarnation in struggle fissures,The boxing match is the public incarnation of all conflict II 32 totalizing in its own struggle the whole of contemporary irreducibilities and fissures II 26
4590,,in movement this incarnates enveloping,thus one can and must say that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is
4591,,this enveloping,But then he adds I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists
4592,,conceive incarnation make up part that in where define,So although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination unlike the case of the boxing match where we can define the overall entity boxing it still remains unproven that an overall entity History can be said to exist at all
4593,,model got further with without,For all his use of the model of the boxing match Sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer
4594,,show takes within in incarnation conducted rules,It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of boxing which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition
4595,,about those take within system suggests appeal to lost paradise before struggle,But what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified except as Sartre suggests dismissively by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle
4596,,make to shown take part in larger,Such societies make the conflicts of history irreducible to Sartre 's logic unless like the boxing match they can be shown to take part in a larger totalizable category
4597,,work struggle admits finds returns to,However when he poses the question of whether his method could work as well for the class struggle as for the boxing match Sartre admits that he finds it impossible to answer and returns instead to the much easier case of sub-groups
4598,,backtracks assumes larger in takes,Once again he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict takes place
4599,,in announces about proceed with without turns back to stage on way,The major question thus always remains unanswered in the Critique every time that Sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer he turns back to a previous more easily intelligible stage on the way
4600,,accompanied symptomatic in against formed object,His difficulty is accompanied by a no doubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals so that in championing specificities against them he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals History as Totalization that originally formed the object of his project
4601,,At this point in whole open up deeply with,At this point a further contradiction in Sartre 's whole enterprise begins to open up for someone so deeply distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with the notions of totality History and the dialectic
4602,,upon virtues replace with with,As Sartre insists more and more upon the virtues of specificity II 200 05 such is his distaste for Marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them attempting to replace concepts with specificities universals with singulars
4603,,goes to extent,His scepticism goes to the extent of even denying the existence of society or the nation as such II 24 61 the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires
4604,,Here with,Here certain similarities with later post-Marxist theorists such as Foucault or Lyotard begin to become apparent
4605,,assume quickly taken further,But if Sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume too quickly that they have simply taken his insights further
4606,,formal to in,For Sartre 's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to History insofar as it simply renames in one oxymoronic category the original antithetical terms
4607,,Without articulation separate,Without an adequate theory of their articulation they simply begin to separate again
4608,,celebrated in,The poet Marbod of Rennes celebrated in Latin the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops
4609,,highlights force in punishing fruit increasing in,The poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime the fruit of princely peace-keeping and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare
4610,,in to to on,Intellectuals claimed a formative influence in the second too John of Marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read Vegetius ' De Re Militari to Geoffrey le Bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan and ascribed his success to their advice on firebombs
4611,,in vulnerability to in,But common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to battering-rams and catapults for even in 1100 they were as a rule primitive structures

4663,,remote connection with with gave to viewed with mixed feelings,Thierry 's remote connection with the family of Godfrey de Bouillon along with his marriage with Sybilla of Anjou Fulk V 's daughter gave him some claim to the throne of Jerusalem as a consequence the aristocracy of Outremer viewed him and Philip with mixed feelings expecting much of them yet fearing their ambitions

4695,,appear disappear fashion progress dictate occupy place in presence sub in,Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention

4700,,That thing,That is the second thing to notice the philosopher 's children are boys

4703,,has end,Education has an end
4704,,about value prompts strong turns out,Although it is fashionable to talk about its value for its own sake what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be
4705,,Where end role where end production valued conception serve,Where the end is person- rather than role that is where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of say information technologists then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve

4708,,directed at production free autonomous,Education has been directed at the production of the rational the free the independent of mind the dignified in short the autonomous human being
4709,,designed between to point where admitted this defining to,Yet because the philosopher 's adult has traditionally been male his children boy children and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species

4711,,occurs congenitally narrow isolated in defining autonomous in to separates group from,The degeneration occurs not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow libertine isolated or selfish but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others
4712,,curiously foundation upon build autonomy,It is a curiously paradoxical foundation upon which to build a theory of autonomy
4713,,autonomy concerned with with groups conception autonomy upon group displays,Moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction
4714,,This about accounts autonomy with autonomy,This paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself

4716,,in nature,Why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children
4717,,connected with role in,There are of course the familiar and obvious reasons connected with women 's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too
4718,,dismiss together with,When philosophers dismiss women as not-men they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics

4721,,said,Schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like
4722,,this autonomy to it to among,A common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics
4723,,this this autonomous,We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves we can ask further questions are children like this is this why children are not autonomous
4724,,find offensive,Again women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive

4727,,accident liberation form part wider movement liberation liberation part bound have fellow groups with,It is no accident that the liberation of women such as it is should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general liberation for one part of the not-men is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you
4728,,groups in with firmly see in section showing ground distinguishing between false immediately commits to view ground in distinguishing from,The assumption that all groups in the not-men class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that as we shall see in the fourth section it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that for example some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children
4729,,That say about saying about false,That 's what they used to say about women is not a proof that saying it about a child is false

4731,,given follows given occurs in over in,That when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of Mill 's famous disclaimer in his essay On Liberty

4736,,This view see attacked on grounds rests on false between with between,This view as we shall see has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings
4737,,attacks based on observation,The attacks are based on empirical observation most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational
4738,,in that embraced liberty,If we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children

4759,,taken from injury against,Children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions
4760,,view encapsulated in autonomous on capacity in pursuit of goals,The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous that is on a standard interpretation they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals
4761,,say goals form,It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they can not choose the goals or that they can not form strategies to achieve them or both
4762,,In to justified there rests,In either case the political implication is that denying rights to children is entirely justified and there the matter rests
4763,,In this things look with picture observation immature,In all this there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher 's child with our mental picture Aristotle 's observation that children are immature and Mill 's suggestion that they might need protection
4764,,Beyond that remote,Beyond that the similarities seem remote
4765,,with in on on,There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle
4766,,account leaves room in about things in those refer to,Apart from being false such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states
4767,,tension between these views autonomous in those from,The tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill

4771,,tell have,Hobbes does not tell us but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have
4772,,here talking about,It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child
4773,,in respond to,Perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others
4774,,distinguish from higher force in way exclude,But then either Hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of intelligently must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals

4785,,in picture,All in all it is a pretty unconvincing picture
4786,,say for that from these,If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are

4789,,thing original signs forgery,The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery
4790,,recognition written off in stakes autonomy on this account led on account,The recognition that children can not simply be written off in the rationality stakes and can not therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they can not therefore be denied it on any account

4799,,makes firm reduced to,He makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years and remarks
4800,,control setting at naught add,We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult not to mention the which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add
4801,,conduct from this damage,Perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible
4802,,have wise enlightened humane observations make about upon these show putting without,Now Holt and Harris both have many wise enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children but as these remarks show putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter
4803,,suffer from form myopia in here referring to,Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions

4809,,open bitter from,He might then be open to bitter objections from many adults
4810,,These far from liberation deeply damaging to contains capacity in disguise,These two suggestions far from being enlightened liberation of all children are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some and Harris 's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise

4814,,take,Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her who will

4835,,in end face,Holt and Harris both in the end face the same problem
4836,,attack pointing out given to,They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all
4837,,achieve manage produce situation in indistinguishable from rests on premises defended gain defence to charge,Whatever else such a strategy may achieve it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which unless they can be defended gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness

4839,,with views looked at tie autonomy firmly to that interpreted in broad narrow sense,The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense

5177,,with [formula] taken breaks down in Section,It is correct for most of the chapter with [formula] taken as a constant but breaks down for ferromagnetic materials which will be discussed in Section 3.11
5178,,simplest starting point,All the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem
5179,,introduce formulations,We shall therefore introduce a number of alternative formulations
5180,,search potential function in,First we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics
5181,,found there scalar function in form [formula] automatically satisfy field strength [formula],We found there that by choosing a scalar function in the form [formula] we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength [formula]

5183,,thing,No but we can do a similar thing
5184,,[formula] satisfied potential called without potential defined [formula],Since it is the equation [formula] that needs to be satisfied we should choose the potential as a vector called not without logic the vector potential defined by the equation [formula]
5185,,Substituting above into get [formula] obtain form [formula],Substituting the above equation into eqn 3.1 we get [formula] or using the vector relation eqn A.6 we obtain the modified form [formula]
5186,,This further to [formula] in this called gauge [formula],This equation can be further simplified to [formula] by choosing in the physicist 's jargon this is called choosing the gauge [formula]

5197,,simple integration yield given,A simple integration will yield A if J is given
5198,,go through,We shall go through a number of examples later
5199,,above expression deriving law,For the moment let us use the above expression for deriving Biot-Savart 's law
5200,,assume current density to in integration to [formula] where to [formula] along,First we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to [formula] where S is a vector normal to the cross-section [formula] is the area of the cross-section and dI is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire
5201,,further constant in form [formula] field strength [formula],Noting further that J.S = I and that I must be constant along the wire we may write eqn 3.15 in the modified form [formula] whence the magnetic field strength is [formula]
5202,,stop here sort out,We have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinates
5203,,in field,As may be seen in Fig. 3.1 the coordinates of the wire element are x' y' z' whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinates
5204,,curl operates on on those leading to [formula] where in made in,Thus the curl operates on the coordinates of P but not on those of dl leading to [formula] where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation A3 in the Appendix

5217,,then potential scalar in,Can we claim then that the vector potential is as useful as its scalar counterpart in electrostatics
5218,,find components with with quantity given curl curl,It is always laborious to find the components of a vector so we are not much better off with A than with H or B. It turns out however that A is a more basic quantity of physics than B. Since B is given by the curl of A it is possible that A is finite while its curl is zero
5219,,under these has on,Interestingly under these conditions A has an effect on certain quantum-mechanical phenomena
5220,,to potential to say those formulations have applications in sensitive to based on that lose banned with immediate effect,It would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanics to say that none of those formulations have engineering applications in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory but by and large engineers would n't lose much sleep if the use of A were banned with immediate effect
5221,,potential popular among directly,The vector potential is not a popular variable among engineers maybe because it is not directly measurable
5222,,capable,There are no instruments capable to measure the magnitude or direction of A.

5225,,good formulae serve in following sections,We have now collected a good number of formulae which will serve us well in the following sections
5226,,Before going on about steady currents,Before going on just a few words about the classification of steady currents
5227,,roughly divided into parts,It may be roughly divided into two parts magnetostatics and the rest
5228,,Sections that give significance fields,We shall discuss the rest first Sections 3.2–3.5 and that will give us some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic fields
5229,,Sections concerned with where fields assumed studied,Sections 3.6–3.16 are concerned with magnetostatics where electric fields are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of J H and B are studied
5230,,have in appear this in section,Since we have so many variables and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear we will record just for this chapter the non-zero variables in each section heading
5231,,beam,The defocusing of an electron beam J E D p H B
5232,,far about positive negative charges about point charges charge,We have so far talked about positive and negative charges about point charges and distributed charge
5233,,introduce charge carried called,I shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge 1.6 × 10 -19 C carried by an elementary particle called the electron
5234,,This,This is not a necessity
5235,,study without household make,It is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron but since it has become such a household word and is used so often we can just as well make use of it
5236,,In present section consider beam charge density travel with,In the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform p = Po and all electrons travel with velocity v.
5237,,going into beams to subject beam forces on,We are not going to enquire into the details how such beams can be produced it belongs to the subject of physical electronics we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the forces on the outermost electrons
5238,,charge [formula] yielding component field [formula],There is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length [formula] yielding for the radial component of the electric field [formula]
5239,,field obtained from law follows [formula] where line taken over current beam [formula] component field in specified [formula,The magnetic field may be obtained from Ampère 's law eqn 3.21 as follows [formula] where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a Fig. 3.2 I is the total current of the beam and [formula] is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by [formula
5240,,From get [formula,From eqn 3.26 we get [formula
5241,,force on charge travelling beam in pointing,The electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam R = a is it is in the radial direction pointing outwards
5242,,force to field [formula,The magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion +z axis and the direction of magnetic field [formula direction
5243,,product gives force in,The vectorial product v X B gives an inward force in the radial direction
5244,,force on [formula,Hence the net force on the electron is [formula
5245,,[formula [formula derived in Section get following formula force [formula where,Noting that [formula and anticipating the relationship [formula to be derived in Section 5.7 we get the following formula for the force [formula where c is the velocity of light
5246,,seen from above force force approaches,It may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approaches the velocity of light
5247,,forces beam unstable,Thus the conclusion is that owing to the repulsive forces between the electrons a cylindrical electron beam is unstable
5248,,technical term borrowed from say beam,Using a technical term borrowed from electron optics we could say that the electron beam gets defocused
5249,,far from in,The other conclusion as far as it is permissible to generalize from a single example is more important in principle
5250,,concerned with forces,It is concerned with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces
5251,,charged travel close to forces smaller forces,Since charged particles rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces are by orders of magnitude smaller than the electric forces
5252,,then have in in fields,Why is it then that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields
5253,,charges cancels field has,The reason is of course that there are two kinds of electric charges and their effect usually cancels so the small magnetic field has a chance of getting observed
5254,,that brings to,And that brings us to the ext example
5255,,Pinch,3.3 Pinch effect J H B
5256,,In contrast to investigate beam charge carriers negative positive about at,In contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kinds of charge carriers negative electrons and some positive particles which I do not wish to be more precise about at the moment
5257,,assume have densities in opposite,We shall assume that the two kinds of particles have equal densities and move in opposite directions
5258,,charge field,As a result there is no net space charge and hence no electric field
5259,,currents on hand cancel opposite charges opposite to,The currents on the other hand do not cancel because they represent opposite charges moving in opposite directions remember minus one times minus one is equal to plus one
5260,,field strength given substitute current where refer to negative positive,The magnetic field strength is given again by eqn 3.27 we only need to substitute for the current In + Ip where the subscripts n and p refer to negative and positive particles respectively
5261,,force on beam [formula on positive [formula,Hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam at R = a is [formula and on the positive particle is [formula
5262,,force in,Note that the force is inwards and in the same direction for both particles
5263,,In that under force,In that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force
5264,,beam tell forces larger,But if the diameter of the beam is reduced eqns 3.33 and 3.34 tell us that the forces are even larger
5265,,then,What happens then
5266,,then beam go on,If everything was uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing
5267,,In beam possess,In practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry
5268,,Under these predict behaviour,Under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles
5269,,drawn without further,Nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn without doing any further mathematics
5270,,positive,The positive particle is immobile
5271,,In this positive lattice,In practice this means that the positive ions are part of the crystal lattice
5272,,then force on on,There is then no magnetic force on the ions only on the electrons
5273,,want hold back virtue,So the electrons want to move inwards but can not because the ions hold them back by virtue of their electrostatic attraction
5274,,force on force upon,Naturally if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well i.e. owing to the magnetic force on the electrons there is also an inward force upon the ions
5275,,tries in under,So the whole crystal structure tries to contract or in other words the material is under pressure see Example 3.2
5276,,In this small forces on current- conductors,In any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the forces on current- conductors
5277,,Flow patterns law,Flow patterns and Ohm 's law J E D

5279,,assumed charge carriers with,We just assumed that certain charge carriers moved with certain velocities
5280,,say in current density to field in form [formula where [formula,Now we shall say that in a class of materials the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field in mathematical form [formula where [formula is the conductivity of the material
5281,,above good,The above equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess
5282,,up to high fields,It is valid for nearly all materials up to quite high electric fields
5283,,field,Will there be a magnetic field
5284,,current field,Yes of course whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field as well
5285,,field upon pinch in section,But the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section
5286,,safely field determining lines current flow,Thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the lines of current flow
5287,,then left with [formula [formula [formula,We are then left with only one equation [formula or [formula or [formula depending on our preference
5288,,tells with in,Eqn 3.38 tells us that there is some analogy see Example 3.3 with the electrostatic case treated in Chapter 2
5289,,in assuming with [formula field lines lines current flow,We may in fact reinterpret any of the diagrams of Figs 2.25 -(2.31) by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity [formula and the field lines are now the lines of current flow as well
5290,,current flows potential drop part with current flows charge,Not really because 1 as current flows there is some potential drop in the electrode itself 2 zero conductivity for part of the space can not be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with Er = 0 and 3 when current flows through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary see Example 3.4
5291,,worth these called upon lines current conductor,It is not worth discussing any of these complications because one is rarely called upon to work out lines of current in a conductor
5292,,return to simple deriving law,We shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving Ohm 's law
5293,,apply,We shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section S and apply a voltage between the ends
5294,,field then [formula current density [formula current [formula,The electric field is then [formula the current density [formula and the current [formula
5295,,From circuit [formula where resistance,From circuit theory [formula where R is the resistance of the material
5296,,get [formula,Comparing eqns 3.41 and 3.42 we get [formula
5297,,[formula get in resistance to to,Since [formula is by definition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to its cross-section
5298,,resistance arrived at worth trouble,A more general definition of resistance valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived at but it is hardly worth the trouble
5299,,[formula to law,The essential thing is that the relation [formula is equivalent to Ohm 's law
5300,,Risking circuit in refer to law,Risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do in fact refer to eqn 3.35 as Ohm 's law

7529,,that fine,Well that 's fine
7530,,get,they get permission then
7531,,managed this about,They somehow managed to persuade the owners apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings even they had been refused access
7532,,this about,this was about last week 's episode
7533,,about,I think it was about last week 's epi but they seem to e imply that it was last week 's episode that would
7534,,do,do it
7535,,before,We seem to have got one spare video if we do n't get it watched before Wednesday
7536,,that,Well that 's the only chance
7537,,about about,Erm not it was n't about your dad it was about my birthday cos
7538,,that thing,I think that 's the thing
7539,,on,Anyway I asked her if she 'd heard from your dad and she has heard from your dad apparently on Friday he went to the consultant
7540,,next got,and next week he 's got his first well she did n't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy
7541,,trotting,And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now
7542,,go on see,I do n't know how long it 's going to go on for or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see
7543,,things moved,But at least things have moved and at least they 've gone round
7544,,quickly,Interesting that they 've done it so quickly is n't it
7545,,After take got over that,After seeing him because he thought that once he 'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started but they must have got themselves over that
7546,,get moving,Got ta get moving
7547,,upset that,And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him has had tha upset that thrombosis again

7554,,that got,but presumably your mum can do that for they 've got hundreds of people there he 's always driving people everywhere
7555,,That,That 's right
7556,,see,so I do n't see why they ca n't drive him
